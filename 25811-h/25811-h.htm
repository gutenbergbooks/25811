<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE REUNION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mollie Thurston, we are lost!&#8221;
cried Barbara dramatically.
</p>
<p>The two sisters were in the depth
of a New Jersey woods one afternoon in early
September.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what if we are!&#8221; laughed Mollie,
leaning over to add a cluster of wild asters to
her great bunch of golden rod. &#8220;We have two
hours ahead of us. Surely such clever woodsmen
as we are can find our way out of woods
which are but a few miles from home. Suppose
we should explore a real forest some day.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be too heavenly! Come on, lazy
Barbara! We shall reach a clearing in a few
moments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lack sympathy, Miss Mollie Thurston;
that&#8217;s your trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara was laughing, yet she anxiously
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
scanned the marshy ground as she picked her
way along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind being lost in these woods
a bit more than you do, if I were not so horribly
afraid of snakes. Oh, my! this place
looks full of &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not poisonous, Bab, or I might be
more sympathetic,&#8221; said Mollie reassuringly.
&#8220;The snakes in these woods are harmless.
How can a girl as brave as you are be such a
goose about a poor, wriggly little &#8216;sarpint,&#8217; that
couldn&#8217;t harm you if it tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-o!&#8221; shivered Bab. &#8220;One&#8217;s own pet fear
has nothing to do with sense or nonsense.
Kindly remember your own feelings toward the
timid mouse! Just the same, I should like to
play &#8216;Maid Marian&#8217; for a while and dwell in
the heart of a woodland glen. If ever I have a
chance to go on a camping trip, I shall get rid
of my fear of snakes, somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bab,&#8221; said Mollie, after a moment&#8217;s pause,
&#8220;hasn&#8217;t it been dreadfully dull since Ruth and
her father went away? Do you think they will
ever come back? I can hardly believe it has
been only three weeks since they left Kingsbridge,
and only six weeks since we came back
from Newport. Anyhow I am glad Grace Carter
is home again from her visit to her brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Mollie, do!&#8221; encouraged Bab.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;Ruth has promised to pay us a visit before she
goes home to Chicago, and she is a girl of her
word, as you and I well know. I am expecting
a letter from her every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mollie ejaculated in heart-felt tones,
&#8220;I know I am nearly dead to see her. Grace
and I were talking of it only yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, I don&#8217;t want to be a croaker,&#8221; began
Bab, after a little hesitation, &#8220;but have you
noticed that mother seems worried about something?
When I was talking yesterday about
how crazy I was to go to Vassar some day,
mother looked as though she wanted to cry. I
stopped there and then. She has seemed so gay
and cheerful until recently. I wonder whether
she is worried about money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie nodded her head and frowned. &#8220;Now
you speak of it, Bab, I believe I have noticed
that she seems depressed at times. I think she
is tired out and needs a complete change. She
had a long letter from Cousin Betty in St. Paul
yesterday, asking her to make a visit. I think
mother should accept. You and I are certainly
big enough to look after ourselves until school
commences. Let&#8217;s beg her to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mollie, we will,&#8221; said her older
sister, &#8220;but if the family funds are even lower
than usual, where is the money to come from
for such an expensive trip? Just the same, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
shall question mother, and find out what&#8217;s the
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab was walking on bravely, trying to forget
her horror of snakes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;that I can feel my
feet trembling inside my boots; I am so afraid
of stepping on one of the wretched little pests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had rained the day before, and the ground
under the thick tangle of trees and underbrush
being unusually marshy, the girls had to pick
their way carefully. Mollie walked ahead
while they were talking. Barbara jumping
from the twisted root of one tree to another
half a yard away, felt something writhe and
wriggle under her foot. Without stopping to
look down, she shrieked&mdash;&#8220;A snake! a snake!&#8221;&mdash;and
ran blindly forward. Before Mollie had
time to look around, Barbara caught her foot
under a root and tumbled headlong into the
wet mud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bab,&#8221; cried Mollie, &#8220;you certainly have
gone and done it this time! How wet and
muddy you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She picked up a stick and raked in the leaves
near her sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See, here&#8217;s what you have made such a fuss
about, a tiny garter snake, that couldn&#8217;t hurt
a thing. You&#8217;ve crushed the thing with your
heel.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Mollie turned suddenly. &#8220;Barbara, what is
the matter with you?&#8221; she asked, as she caught
a glimpse of her sister&#8217;s face. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you get up? Can I help you?&#8221; She leaned
over her sister.
</p>
<p>Poor Bab&#8217;s face was white as a sheet, and she
was trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do help me if you can,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t get up by myself. I&#8217;m afraid I have
turned my ankle. Here, take my hand. Sitting
here in this mud I feel as if I had fallen
into a nest of snakes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie gave Bab both her hands. Setting her
teeth, Bab tried to rise, but, with a groan, sat
down again. The second time Mollie pulled
with all her might. Barbara, summoning her
courage, rose slowly to her feet. Without
speaking she leaned against the trunk of the
nearest tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait here, dear,&#8221; urged Mollie, more worried
than she would show. &#8220;I will try and find
you a stick. Then if you lean on me and use
the stick in the other hand, perhaps we can get
along all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were several miles from home and in
another hour the dusk would be upon them. So
the two girls struggled bravely on through the
thick woods, though it was difficult to walk
abreast in the narrow path. Barbara insisted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
she was better with each step, but Mollie knew
otherwise. With every foot of ground they
covered Bab limped more and more painfully.
Now and then when her injured foot pressed
too heavily on the rough ground, she caught
her breath and swallowed a groan. Mollie realized
they would not get home before midnight
at the rate they were now moving.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rest here, Bab,&#8221; she insisted, when they
came to an opening in the woods where the
shade was less dense. &#8220;I think I see a place
over there that must lead into a road. I will
run on ahead and find some one to come back to
help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab was glad to sit down. Her foot was
swelling and growing more painful every moment;
her pulses were throbbing. She was almost
crying, but she would never mention surrender;
she was not sorry, however, when Mollie
suggested that she should rest.
</p>
<p>Mollie sped through the woods as fast as she
could run. As soon as her back was turned,
Bab closed her eyes. &#8220;How glad I am to rest,&#8221;
she thought gratefully.
</p>
<p>In the half hour that Barbara Thurston
waited alone her mind wandered to many of
her own hopes and fears. First, she couldn&#8217;t
help worrying over her mother. Then, she
thought of her own ambition. More than anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
in the world she longed to go to Vassar College.
In two years more she would be ready to
enter, but where was the money to come from?
Barbara realized that her mother would never
be able to pay her expenses from their small
income; nevertheless, she meant to go. The
Kingsbridge High School offered a scholarship
at Vassar to the girl who passed the best final
examinations during the four years of its
course. Barbara had won the highest honors
in her freshman and sophomore years, but she
had two more winters of hard work ahead of
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she thought at last, &#8220;if I can
persuade Ruth to go to college with me?&#8221; Then
she must have fallen into a little doze.
</p>
<p>Readers of the preceding volume, &#8220;The Automobile
Girls at Newport,&#8221; will remember how
the famous little club, known as &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; came to be organized, and they are
familiar with the exciting and humorous incidents
of that journey in Ruth Stuart&#8217;s motor
car. There were many adventures along the
way, including mysterious encounters with a
gentlemanly young rascal, known to the police
as &#8220;The Boy Raffles.&#8221; The same &#8220;Raffles&#8221;
afterwards turned up at Newport, where the
girls for several weeks led a life of thrilling interest.
&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; it was who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
caught &#8220;Raffles&#8221; red-handed, and who saved
Bab&#8217;s snobbish cousin, Gladys Le Baron, from
falling in love with him.
</p>
<p>Six weeks before, on their return from the
trip to Newport, &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; had
disbanded. Mr. Stuart had given a dinner in
their honor, and at the close of the meal, he
formally presented each of the girls with a miniature
model of Ruth&#8217;s motor car, forming pins
of red enamel about the size of a dime.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must wear them forever,&#8221; Ruth insisted,
almost in tears. &#8220;Who knows what luck they
may bring to us? Remember this isn&#8217;t a real
breaking up of &#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217;; it is
only an &#8216;<i>auf wiedersehen</i>.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The morning after Mr. Stuart&#8217;s dinner,
Grace left Kingsbridge to visit her brother.
Later, Mr. Stuart and his sister, Miss Stuart,
bore Ruth away to spend several weeks with
some relatives in northern New York.
</p>
<p>Ruth confided to Bab her grief at leaving
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I perfectly hate to go,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;Just think, Bab, how soon I shall have to go
back to Chicago, and leave you here in New
Jersey. Other people are well enough in their
places, but they are not my Barbara, Mollie and
Grace!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was after this confidence, that Bab made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Ruth solemnly promise to pay them a visit before
she returned home.
</p>
<p>Barbara opened her eyes suddenly. Had she
been asleep and dreamed of Ruth? She could
almost hear her voice and laugh. Some one
was coming along the path. She could hear
the dead leaves crunch under flying feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara, my Barbara!&#8221; Was it Mollie&#8217;s
voice calling her?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; cried Bab faintly.
</p>
<p>Through the trees running straight toward
her, her eyes shining, her cheeks aglow, was
Ruth Stuart. Barbara tried to leap up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, you poor dear, do,&#8221; Ruth commanded.
&#8220;What have you done to your silly
little self? Never mind; here is your friend
and always devoted slave come to your rescue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; inquired Bab,
weakly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the everywhere into the here. Father
and Mollie will be along in a few seconds and
explain to you. I simply couldn&#8217;t wait for
them. Another dear friend of yours is up the
road desiring to offer you assistance. You may
recall &#8216;Mr. A. Bubble.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth took out the flask of beef tea which she
always carried on a motor trip, and made Barbara
drink a few swallows. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she declared,
&#8220;I will try to tell you how I happen to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
be here. Three days ago I told father I simply
couldn&#8217;t bear to be away from Kingsbridge
twenty-four hours longer. So he and I decided
that as soon as manners would permit we
should put the automobile in commission and
fly to you as fast as we could. And here we
are! Besides, just think how quickly the holiday
time is passing. I have another scheme&mdash;but
here come Mollie and father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart and Mollie were approaching
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you, Barbara,&#8221; said Mr. Stuart,
putting his strong arm around the injured girl
and nearly lifting her from the ground. &#8220;Can
you manage to walk? Ruth, you help from the
other side. It is not far to the road, and once
we get you there, the auto will soon take you
home to that little mother of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare I would just like to kiss &#8216;Mr. A.
Bubble,&#8217; if I knew an appropriate place,&#8221; declared
Barbara, when she was at last safely
stowed away in the automobile. Her lame foot
was propped up on soft cushions while close
beside her sat her beloved Ruth holding her
hand. Mollie was sitting in front with Mr.
Stuart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; Barbara continued, &#8220;no one has
properly explained it to me how you happened
to be at the right place just at the right moment?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
And how did Mollie find you to tell you
I was concealed in the woods with a sprained
ankle? It&#8217;s too much for me. Please explain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast, Miss Thurston, if you please,&#8221;
pleaded Mr. Stuart. &#8220;Ruth and I would like to
be regarded as angels dropped from the sky,
but the truth must be told! She and I were
speeding along this very road, a little faster
than is perfectly proper, as we were hoping to
make our way before dusk to the home of a
charming lady, Mrs. Thurston, who lives with
her two attractive daughters, in Laurel Cottage,
Kingsbridge. What did we see? A small, excited
girl ahead of us, who seemed to be trying
to run faster than our auto could travel. Nevertheless,
we caught up with her. Who do you
think she was? Miss Mollie Thurston! We
were all so surprised that it must have taken
us quite a minute to explain matters to each
other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can imagine,&#8221; added Mistress Mollie
from the front seat, &#8220;how jolly glad I was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some time Mrs. Thurston had been anxiously
awaiting her daughters&#8217; return. She
was standing at the gate of her home, when a
familiar chug, chug, chug, sounded up the road.
&#8220;I must be dreaming,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I am so
worried at the girls being out late that I imagine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
I hear Ruth&#8217;s automobile bringing them
home to me. How lonely it has been for us all
since Ruth and her father went away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chug, chug, chug,&#8221; the noise sounded
louder than ever. A splash of red appeared
at the turn of the road, a siren whistle blew,
and a well-known, crimson motor car rapidly
approached her gate. Mrs. Thurston rubbed
her eyes. It was the Stuart&#8217;s automobile and
no other. Sitting enthroned in it was that
gentleman and his daughter. And, could it be
possible? Barbara and Mollie, as well!
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston&#8217;s gentle face glowed with
pleasure. Switfly as a girl she threw open her
gate and was waiting on the sidewalk when the
car stopped in front of her with a flourish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so delighted to see you,&#8221; she said, extending
her hand to Mr. Stuart and kissing
Ruth on both cheeks. &#8220;Where did you find
my daughters? But what&#8217;s the matter with
you, Bab?&#8221; she asked, as she noticed her child&#8217;s
pale cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, now, mother,&#8221; said Bab, hopping
up, but sitting down again just as promptly.
&#8220;I have sprained my ankle a little, not very
much. I would like to get into the house to
take off my shoe. It pinches until I feel like
the mean sister trying to squeeze her foot into
Cinderella&#8217;s slipper.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in with me, every one of you,&#8221; she
pleaded. &#8220;Dear Mr. Stuart, you are not going
to take Ruth up to the hotel with you for even
one night. Remember, you promised she was
to visit us, as soon as you returned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let me stay, father,&#8221; coaxed Ruth,
dancing after them. &#8220;I have no trunk to worry
about at present. Aunt Sallie is coming back,
day after to-morrow, and she is to bring my
trunk with her. Father and I traveled all the
way in the automobile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston followed Mr. Stuart out as he
was saying good-bye. He had agreed to leave
Ruth with them. &#8220;Mr. Stuart, you can go to
your hotel, if you wish to engage your room,
but you must come back and have tea with us.
We have hot rolls, honey, and fresh milk for
supper. There is no use in your denying that
is your favorite evening meal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to deny it, Mrs. Thurston,&#8221;
was Mr. Stuart&#8217;s answer, as he stepped into his
car. &#8220;I will come back with pleasure. On
my way to the hotel I shall call at the doctor&#8217;s
and ask him to come around and look after
Bab&#8217;s foot.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>NEW LIGHT ON OLD PAPERS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you are worried about something,&#8221;
said Barbara to her mother
early the next morning as they sat
alone in their little dining room, which was
bright with the September sun.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston started nervously. She had
been thinking so deeply that Bab&#8217;s voice had
startled her.
</p>
<p>Mollie and Ruth had rushed off early to
find Grace and bring her back with them. Susan,
the maid, was in the yard hanging up
her dish towels. Mrs. Thurston had supposed
Bab was deep in reading the history of
David Copperfield, which lay open on her
lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t answer me, mother,&#8221; complained
Barbara, as she saw her mother&#8217;s face flush under
her gaze. &#8220;You might as well &#8216;&#8217;fess up&#8217;
and be done with it. I know there is something
wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston hesitated; then she answered
quietly: &#8220;You are right, Bab, dear. I am very
much worried and it is about money. But I did
not want you children to know of it until I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
obliged to tell you. Barbara, half of our income
is gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; cried Barbara, &#8220;what do you
mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dear,&#8221; said her mother quietly, &#8220;the
money has not entirely gone yet. But I fear it
soon will go. Your uncle wrote me that some
stock he bought for me had been going down,
down, until finally it will cease paying dividends
altogether and be of no value. How shall we
manage then? I have been lying awake at
night trying to plan. You know it takes every
cent we have to live in even the simplest way.
Oh, Bab, what shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara looked grave. &#8220;Did Uncle Ralph
write you about this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Thurston, &#8220;two or three
weeks ago. I have had it on my mind ever since.
Your uncle used to own some of this same stock,
but he wrote me he had sold out some time ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange he didn&#8217;t tell us to sell at the
same time,&#8221; Barbara reflected. &#8220;What does
Uncle Ralph propose that we do? He is so
rich I think he might show some interest in you,
poor dear. You are his only sister, especially
since he has made all his money out of the business
father founded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Ralph suggests,&#8221; Mrs. Thurston
faltered, &#8220;that we find some work to do. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
you and Mollie must be educated, and I am so
ignorant of business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara&#8217;s cheeks were crimson and her brown
eyes flashed. &#8220;I think, mother,&#8221; she said
quietly, &#8220;it will be just as well for us to learn
a little more about Uncle Ralph&#8217;s management
of our business. I am going to consult Mr.
Stuart; I am sure he will give us good advice; he
is such a clear-headed business man. Don&#8217;t you
worry, mother, dear, for I am sure things will
turn out all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston rose to go out to market.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you go, mother,&#8221; Barbara begged,
&#8220;will you please let me see the roll of father&#8217;s
business papers you have stored away in the
trunk in the attic. Oh, I know they are of no
value, but just the same I am curious to see
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you are so determined, all right,&#8221;
sighed Mrs. Thurston.
</p>
<p>Before she left the house she handed Barbara
a roll of old papers tied with a crimson cord.
</p>
<p>Bab sat pondering with the papers in her lap.
She was more frightened at her mother&#8217;s news
than she would show. They were mere girls,
she and Mollie, and their little mother had no
knowledge of business. She shook herself impatiently.
Barbara was an optimist&mdash;things
would turn out all right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>Soon Bab wrinkled her forehead and tried to
settle down to her work; the papers were altogether
incomprehensible to her. Most of them
were old business contracts. Yet, here was one
that seemed a bit different. It was in Uncle
Ralph Le Baron&#8217;s handwriting, but so faded
that it was difficult to read. Slowly Bab
deciphered it: &#8220;On demand, I promise to pay
to John Thurston the sum of five thousand dollars
for value received.&#8221; To this was appended
her uncle&#8217;s well-known signature, Ralph Le
Baron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; sighed Barbara, as she started to tie
the papers together again, &#8220;I suppose Uncle
Ralph settled this debt a long time ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly a big, cheerful presence darkened
the doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Bab!&#8221; called Mr. Stuart. &#8220;Why are
you alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls have gone up to the Squire&#8217;s for
Grace,&#8221; Bab explained, &#8220;and mother is at
market. But do please come in and wait for
them. Ruth told me to keep you; she wants to
ask you about something very important.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I inquire what you are doing, Barbara?&#8221;
Mr. Stuart queried, taking a seat. &#8220;Are
you preparing to be a lawyer&#8217;s clerk that you
spend your spare hours poring over musty
business papers?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>Barbara blushed. &#8220;I am almost ashamed to
tell you, Mr. Stuart, but you and Ruth have
been so awfully good to us, I think I shall just
ask you one more favor. These are some business
papers my father left when he died. No
one has ever looked them over. I have always
wondered if they could be of any value. Of
course I know it is foolish of me to even dream
of such a thing. But would you mind glancing
at them, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara handed the roll of documents to
her friend with such a pretty look of pleading
in her brown eyes that a much harder
hearted man than Mr. Stuart could not have refused
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; I shall be glad to have a look at
them,&#8221; Mr. Stuart answered.
</p>
<p>Tick, tock, tick, tock. The only sound in the
room was the soft refrain of the old clock on the
mantel. Barbara held her breath, but she knew
she was foolish to feel so excited.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart examined the papers closely. One
after another he read them through. This big
western man who had made a fortune by his
own brains and ability, was devoting the same
care to Barbara&#8217;s apparently worthless papers
that he would give to his own important business
affairs. Suddenly he looked up. He held in
his hand the promissory note signed by Ralph
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Le Baron acknowledging his debt for five
thousand dollars to his brother-in-law, John
Thurston.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume,&#8221; Mr. Stuart said quietly to Bab,
&#8220;that your uncle settled this debt years ago;
but if he did, why was the note never canceled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment Mr. Stuart and Barbara
heard a rustle of skirts, and looking up they saw
Mrs. Thurston, her arms full of bundles, and her
face white. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she said
in a strange, hard voice. &#8220;What money should
have been paid by my brother years ago?
Please explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Mr. Stuart, so quietly you could
have heard a pin drop in the stillness of the little
room, &#8220;I mean, of course, this five thousand
dollars, which, as I see by the date, your brother
borrowed from your husband eleven years ago.
Let me see, that was one year before your husband&#8217;s
death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston sank into a chair. Mr. Stuart
reached her just in time to save her from falling.
He took the bundles from her hand and
waited. For a minute Mrs. Thurston could not
speak.
</p>
<p>Barbara felt her heart pounding away and her
pulses throbbing; but she made no sound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was this money paid you by your brother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
when he settled your estate?&#8221; Mr. Stuart repeated
his question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; faltered Mrs. Thurston.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any memorandum among your
husband&#8217;s papers which would prove that the
money was returned to him before his death?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston shook her head. Barbara was
staring at her mother with wide open brown
eyes, her cheeks paling, then flushing. Here
was a mystery!
</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother,&#8221; said Mrs. Thurston finally,
&#8220;settled my affairs for me at the time of my
husband&#8217;s sudden death. I was too crushed to
realize what was taking place, and I had no idea
that we would be brought to poverty. But I
know I saw no such paper as you mention. Until
this minute, I never heard that my brother borrowed
any money from my husband. Oh, it
simply can&#8217;t be true&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can&#8217;t be true, mother?&#8221; inquired Bab
at last. Her mother did not answer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart quietly folded up the mysterious
paper and put it in his pocket. &#8220;It may be that
Mr. Le Baron can explain this situation at
once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is staying at the same hotel
with me. If you will permit me I will inquire
into the matter for you. Now don&#8217;t worry yourselves
about it any more,&#8221; Mr. Stuart ended, resuming
his natural manner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>To himself he told a different story. &#8220;This
looks bad, very bad!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If Ralph
Le Baron had paid this money back he would
have seen that the note was returned to him. I
know him well enough for that. If he never has
paid it, can he be forced to do so now?&#8221; reflected
Mr. Stuart, looking at the matter from all sides.
&#8220;He has never been asked for the money before,
and I do not believe the law requires a debt to be
paid after six years, if no claim has been previously
made for it, and it is now eleven years
since the note was made. I must look into the
matter. A man who could rob his widowed sister
and nieces of five thousand dollars would be
guilty of any crime. I shall make it hot for him
unless he can tell a straight story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is everybody looking so serious?&#8221;
called out a gay voice, and Ruth, followed by
Mollie and Grace, entered the room.
</p>
<p>The little group within the room started
guiltily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is mystery in the very air,&#8221; declaimed
Ruth, &#8220;you are trying to conceal something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a goose,&#8221; replied her father fondly,
then nodding reassuringly to Bab and her
mother. &#8220;Who knows what a day may bring
forth?&#8221; he said.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HAPPINESS, AND ANOTHER SCHEME</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Mr. Stuart left his hotel
and went into New York with Mr. Le
Baron. They left Kingsbridge at eight
o&#8217;clock, and did not return until six. Half an
hour later Mr. Stuart called at Laurel Cottage
for Mrs. Thurston in his automobile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will take Miss Barbara with us to the
hotel,&#8221; he said to her mother, &#8220;if you feel it will
not injure her ankle. She need do no walking.
I should prefer that she be with you when you
have an interview with your brother. He is to
see you at the hotel to-night. You will dine with
me first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara&#8217;s foot being better, she and her
mother asked no questions, but with trembling
fingers made ready to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean,&#8221; demanded Ruth and
Mollie, &#8220;by going off on such a mysterious
errand? Why, Mr. Stuart,&#8221; asked Ruth, &#8220;are
Mollie and I not also invited to dinner?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart was obdurate. He offered no explanations.
When Ruth whispered something in
his ear, he answered quietly: &#8220;That will keep,&#8221;
and Ruth said no more.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Le Baron bowed coldly to Mrs.
Thurston and Barbara, when entering the hotel
dining room that night, they found the mother
and daughter dining with Mr. Stuart. But
Gladys Le Baron stopped for a moment at the
able to inquire after Bab&#8217;s foot. She was not
the haughty girl she once had been. Since her
return from Newport she had seemed strangely
fond of Bab.
</p>
<p>Barbara and her mother never knew how they
got through their meal. But Mr. Stuart was a
tower of strength.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not discuss business matters,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;until we go upstairs to my sitting
room. Mr. Le Baron will join us there at half-past
eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Ralph Le Baron entered Mr. Stuart&#8217;s
apartment to keep his appointment, he did not
look into his sister&#8217;s face. He merely inquired
coldly: &#8220;How are you, Mollie?&#8221; and sat down
near the small wood fire which was burning
cosily in the open grate. Not once did he glance
at Barbara, though she kept her eyes fixed steadily
on him. He was a tall, thin man, with high
cheek bones and a nose like an eagle&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thurston,&#8221; began Mr. Stuart, &#8220;your
brother does not claim that he paid to you or
your husband the five thousand dollars which he
undoubtedly borrowed. When I first spoke to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
him of the matter he declared he had never been
loaned any such sum. He had great difficulty in
recalling the incident until I showed him his note
which I still have in my pocket. He explained
afterwards, however, that the matter had passed
entirely out of his mind after your husband&#8217;s
death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston looked at her brother questioningly.
&#8220;It seems very strange to me,
Ralph, that you could have forgotten,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;But perhaps it is all for the best!
We need the money more now than we ever have
before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Le Baron did not answer his sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will find it the wisest plan, Mr.
Le Baron,&#8221; continued Mr. Stuart, breaking the
silence, &#8220;to pay over this money to Mrs. Thurston
and her daughters as soon as you conveniently
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ralph Le Baron knit his brows. Barbara was
watching him closely. There was no love lost
between Bab and her uncle. She had long
looked for some difficulty to arise out of his management
of her mother&#8217;s affairs, but nothing so
serious as this.
</p>
<p>Mr. Le Baron&#8217;s voice sounded cold and hard
as steel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not deceive yourselves,&#8221; he said, with a
sneer. &#8220;I mean you, Mollie, and Mr. Stuart,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
who seems to be taking an unusual interest in
your affairs. I have not the slightest intention
of ever paying back the money!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston&#8217;s manner changed. She spoke
firmly. &#8220;I should be exceedingly sorry, Ralph,
to have any trouble with you over the matter;
but the law must compel you to pay your
debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast, sister,&#8221; smiled Mr. Le Baron,
sarcastically. &#8220;You are coming into a remarkable
business knowledge all at once, but you do
not yet know quite enough. The law does not
compel me after six years to pay a debt which
has not been presented to me within that time.
Perhaps you have never heard of the statute of
limitation. Perhaps your friend, Mr. Stuart,
will make it clear to you. You should have
asked me for this money five or six years ago.
The New York law does not require a debt to be
paid unless a request has been made for its settlement
within six years after the time it was
contracted. The money was loaned to me by
your husband eleven years ago, as we all know
by the date on the note. I have no further concern
in the matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great heavens, man!&#8221; cried Mr. Stuart,
breaking in fiercely, &#8220;you cannot mean to play
your own sister such a low-down, scoundrelly
trick! You will not pay back the money to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
which you confess to owing, simply because she
has not asked you for it before! How could she
ask for it when you alone knew of the debt and
kept the matter a secret? I am not so sure how
your law would stand in such a case. A pretty
story it will make to tell to the men who respect
your business integrity. Mrs. Thurston shall
have a lawyer to inquire into the situation immediately!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A low knock sounded at the door. Before
anyone could answer, Gladys Le Baron walked
smilingly into the room. She looked in surprise
at her father&#8217;s dark, revengeful face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter?&#8221; she inquired, her
face sobering in an instant. &#8220;I wondered why
father ran off by himself to see Aunt Mollie and
Bab. I thought you would like to have me join
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to your apartment at once,
Gladys!&#8221; interrupted her father sternly.
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart turned upon him. &#8220;Ralph Le
Baron, I am going to do something, to-night, that
I never expected to do in my life. I am going to
expose a father to his own child. Wait here a
minute, Gladys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart then told Gladys the whole story.
She stood listening in utter silence, her face
crimson with blushes. Barbara could only look
at her cousin through a mist of tears. When
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Mr. Stuart had ended his story, he said: &#8220;I am
sorry indeed to tell you this, Gladys, but you
must have learned it some day. I do not know
whether your father is right in regard to the law
in this matter, but Mrs. Thurston will carry the
case to court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladys went over to her father, who had never
raised his eyes to look at her, while Mr. Stuart
was speaking, nor did he make any denial.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true, father?&#8221; she asked him at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in a measure true, Gladys,&#8221; her father
answered, &#8220;but it is purely a matter of business,
which you cannot be expected to understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladys put her head down on the arm of the
sofa, where she now sat by her father, and wept
bitterly. There was no other sound in the
room, except an occasional suppressed sob from
Mrs. Thurston. Bab was far too excited and
too angry to cry!
</p>
<p>Finally Gladys raised her head. &#8220;Father, on
my sixteenth birthday, you settled five thousand
dollars on me in my own name!&#8221; She spoke in
a low voice. &#8220;If you do not feel that you ought
to pay back to Aunt Mollie the money you borrowed
from Uncle John, won&#8217;t you please let me
give her this money of mine? I must do it,
father. I can&#8217;t understand the business side of
it, but it just seems to me we owe her the money
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and that&#8217;s all there is to it! I have been horrid
and haughty many times, but I can&#8217;t bear that
we should seem&mdash;dishonest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor Gladys whispered this last dreadful
word under her breath. Then she put her arms
round her father and kissed him. &#8220;You are not
angry with me?&#8221; she asked him.
</p>
<p>If there was one person in the world Ralph Le
Baron truly loved it was his only child, Gladys.
Not for ten times five thousand dollars would he
have had her a witness to the scene which had
just passed between him and his sister. He
meant, of course, to tell her and his wife what
had happened, but he meant to put his own interpretation
on the affair before they heard of
it from anyone else.
</p>
<p>Did his better nature move him? Perhaps it
did. He looked around the room and answered
testily: &#8220;The law certainly does not require that
I return this money to my sister, and business is
business with me. But since my daughter
Gladys and my sister seem to look upon the matter
as a case of sentiment, why I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
spoke slowly. It was hard work for him to get
the words out. &#8220;I will waive strictly business
principles on this occasion, and return the money
to my sister.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O Ralph!&#8221; cried Mrs. Thurston, as though
a great load was lifted from her mind. Barbara
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
rejoiced. But in her heart of hearts she thought
it was hard to have her uncle act as though he
were doing them a favor when he was only paying
them their just dues.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Gladys and her father
withdrew from the room. &#8220;I am so glad,&#8221;
whispered Gladys to Bab, as she passed her
cousin on her way out.
</p>
<p>Barbara held her hand just long enough to
murmur gently: &#8220;Gladys, dear, if I once did you
a kindness, I think you have repaid me a thousand-fold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was after ten o&#8217;clock when &#8220;Mr. A. Bubble&#8221;
bore the travelers home to Laurel Cottage.
Mollie and Ruth were waiting in the sitting
room, with a fire burning cheerily in the grate
and the candles lit over the mantelpiece. In
front of the fire, they had mounted twelve marshmallows,
which they were toasting to a beautiful
brown on twelve hatpins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought you were never coming back,
Mummy,&#8221; said Mollie, taking off her mother&#8217;s
light wrap. &#8220;What has happened to you?&#8221;
she asked as she viewed her mother&#8217;s shining
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good news indeed, Mollie baby!&#8221; her
mother answered. &#8220;We are five thousand dollars
richer than we were when we left home.
Now, perhaps Bab can go to Vassar, and things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
will be a little easier for us, even if the other
money has gone. Mr. Stuart thinks we ought
to have twenty-five dollars a month income
from the five thousand dollars! Isn&#8217;t it too
wonderful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a marshmallow, everyone, do,&#8221; said
Ruth, extending her hatpins. They were comfortably
seated around the fire and the subject
of the money had been dropped. &#8220;I want all
of you to be eating marshmallows except me, so
I can do all the talking. I think I have been
a perfect angel. Father, you know I have kept
a secret to myself for three whole days. Of
course, I told Mollie to-night, when you left
us by ourselves, but that doesn&#8217;t count.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie&#8217;s cheeks were glowing and her eyes
dancing in the soft firelight. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she
added naughtily, &#8220;Ruth and I can keep good
news to ourselves as well as other people. At
least,&#8221; she continued wistfully, her eyes turning
to her mother, &#8220;I hope it is good news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thurston,&#8221; inquired Ruth, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
dearly love &#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Thurston smiled. &#8220;I most certainly
do,&#8221; she replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then all is well!&#8221; Ruth made her a low
curtsey. &#8220;Anyone who truly loves &#8216;The Auto-Girls&#8217;
cannot fail to rejoice at my news. Mrs.
Thurston, we cannot bear to be disbanded. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
must get together again before I go home to
Chicago. Mollie told me she and Bab wanted
you to go on a visit to a cousin in St. Paul,
but they feared you would not consent to leave
them alone. Here&#8217;s where I come in! I want
you to let me take care of your babies, while
you go on your trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth gave an impudent pull at Mollie&#8217;s curls,
as she went on with her request. &#8220;Father and
I have planned another per-fect-ly grand trip for
&#8216;The Automobile Girls!&#8217; Now please don&#8217;t anybody
object until I have finished. Here, eat
another marshmallow! This trip is not to be
in the least like the other one. What I want
is to go for a month on a camping party in the
Berkshire Hills!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! Hear!&#8221; called out Bab, hopping up,
and forgetting all about her sprained ankle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just had this letter from Aunt Sallie,
father,&#8221; continued Ruth. &#8220;She is game!
Of course, she started out by saying she thought
the trip was perfect nonsense; she knew we
would have pneumonia and various other diseases
if we attempted it, but she ended by declaring
that, of course, she could not be left
behind if we were determined on the frolic. She
is a darling! So, now, Mrs. Thurston, if only
you will consent, in a few days we want dear
old &#8216;Bubble,&#8217; to make a start for the Berkshires.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
This is the perfect time of the year and the
mountains will be simply glorious! Oh, I can&#8217;t
talk any more, I am so out of breath! Do go
on please, father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thurston, our plan is not so wild as it
sounds. Ruth will take the girls in her car up
into the Berkshires. I have discovered that on
one of the mountains some distance from the
regular line of travel, is a well built log cabin.
It has big fireplaces in it, and can be made thoroughly
comfortable for September. Early in
October, Ruth wants to go with the girls to the
hotel at Lenox, for a week or two of the autumn
sports there. The automobile can travel comfortably
over most of the Berkshire roads.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart&#8217;s tones were as persuasive as
Ruth&#8217;s. &#8220;But, when the girls come to the
chosen place, they can store the car in some
suitable garage, and take the trails up the sides
of the mountain, either on horseback or afoot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Barbara&#8217;s foot,&#8221; insisted Mrs. Thurston
weakly, in the first pause that gave her an opportunity
to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bab&#8217;s ankle will be all right, mother!&#8221;
Mollie cried. &#8220;We have spoken to the doctor,
and he says Bab will be jumping about as lively
as a cricket in a few days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Thurston,&#8221; said Mr. Stuart, speaking
in his heartiest voice, &#8220;I want to be allowed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
floor in this conversation. I have something to
propose on my own account. A party of friends
of my sister&#8217;s and mine are going west on a
sight seeing trip. Among them is a railroad
president and his wife, and their private car is
to be used for the tour. It would give me great
pleasure to have you meet them and make your
journey to St. Paul in their company. My sister
wishes to assure you that you will find them
thoroughly congenial and will no doubt enjoy
the trip. To tell the truth, Miss Stuart has already
written our friends to expect you, for I
had determined that you should go at all
events.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for our daughters,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
am greatly interested in this camping scheme
for them. I know, from my own experience,
that nothing can be made more delightful than
our modern fashion of &#8216;roughing it.&#8217; I intend
to make the necessary arrangements, and properly
equip this camping party myself. I shall
even run up to the Berkshires for a day or two,
to look over the ground. I want to engage
a guide for the party, and a woman to do the
cooking. Then I must see if the little log cabin
is all the circular says it is. It is rented out
to camping parties all through the year. Come,
Mrs. Thurston,&#8221; questioned Mr. Stuart, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you think this is a good scheme for everyone?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Mr. Stuart!&#8221; Bab called out
rapturously. By this time Mollie and Ruth
were both on the floor, with their arms around
Mrs. Thurston.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do so want to lead &#8216;the simple life,&#8217; dear
Mrs. Thurston,&#8221; Ruth begged. &#8220;Think how
splendid for us to have a month out of doors
before we go back to hard work at school.&#8221;
Ruth made a wry face. She was not fond of
study, like Barbara. &#8220;We may spend a week
or so in Lenox, to please Aunt Sallie. But
most of the time we want to be right in the
mountains. Let me see&mdash;there is Greylock, and
Monument Mountain, and hosts of others not
too far from Lenox. At least, we shall be able
to see them from our mountain top. And we
must escort Bab over to Rattlesnake Mountain,
in honor of her well known fondness for those
charming pets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll look after Bab,&#8221; Mollie spoke in
superior tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Barbara earnestly, &#8220;you
must accept Mr. Stuart&#8217;s charming invitation,
even if you think it wiser for us not to go on
the camping trip with Ruth. I know you need
a change. You have had so much worry, and
now your mind is at rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; said Mrs. Thurston, looking as
bright and happy as one of the girls, &#8220;accept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
my best wishes for the &#8216;Robin Hood Band&#8217; of
&#8216;Automobile Girls!&#8217; I am sure they will soon
rival that celebrated set of woodsmen. Only,
I beg of you, confine your adventures strictly
within the limits of the law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you mean that Bab and Mollie may
go!&#8221; cried Ruth in tones of rapture. &#8220;But we
don&#8217;t intend to play at being an outlaw band.
Kindly regard us as early Puritan settlers in
the New England hills, compelled to seek protection
from the Indians in our log hut. I wish
we could run across a few Indians up there; we
shall be right on their old camping grounds.
There are still some Indian trails in the mountains,
but the Berkshires are so highly civilized,
these days, we shall never find even a trace of
a red man, or a red woman either!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When do we start, Ruth?&#8221; asked Mollie.
&#8220;I should like to be off to-morrow. Remember
how fast the time is going. School begins the
middle of October.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Grace?&#8221; asked Bab thoughtfully.
&#8220;It would hardly be a real &#8216;Automobile
Girls&#8217; party if one of their number should be
left out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is all right about Grace, of course!&#8221;
Ruth answered. &#8220;Goodness me! Haven&#8217;t I
told you? We have already talked our plan
over with Squire Carter, who is delighted to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
have Grace go. He says a month out of doors
will do wonders for her. He only wished he
was not too old to join us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One week later, Miss Sallie Stuart and the
quartette of &#8220;Automobile Girls&#8221; gathered at the
station to speed Mrs. Thurston on her journey.
Mr. Stuart was to accompany her as far as New
York City, and see her safely established among
his friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good children, all of you,&#8221; urged Mrs.
Thurston at the last minute. &#8220;And remember
to keep your feet dry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In case the camping outfit is not thoroughly
satisfactory, Sallie,&#8221; counseled Mr. Stuart,
&#8220;telegraph to New York for whatever you like.
I believe everything is O. K. Remember to
keep your camp fires always burning. You are
to have the most trustworthy guide in the Berkshires,
as well as his wife, to look after you,
and you will never be far from civilization if
you wish to go, Sallie?&#8221; he ended, for Miss Sallie
was looking dismal at the idea of parting.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie nodded her head. &#8220;You know
my views, Robert. If you <i>will</i> permit Ruth to
follow any wild fancy that pops into her head,
at least, I shall be near to see that she gets into
as little mischief as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart&#8217;s last whisper before the train
started was for Bab. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
little mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will see that
things are well with her. That copper stock
she owns is looking up again. She is not to
sell out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart turned to find Ruth for his last
kiss. &#8220;Remember, daughter,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;I
rely on you and Bab to keep cool heads and
clear brains in any emergency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the train moved off, Mr. Stuart and Mrs.
Thurston watched for a few moments a circle of
waving hands. A little later their car swung
around a curve and Kingsbridge was lost to
view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; and Miss Sallie then
repaired to the hotel. Grace, Mollie and Bab
were to be Ruth&#8217;s guests until they started for
the Berkshires. All was in readiness.
</p>
<p>The week before, Mr. Stuart had taken the
girls to New York for a few days&#8217; shopping.
If ever there were young women fitted up in
the proper styles for mountain climbing they
were. Each girl was presented with two pairs
of thick, high boots and leather leggins. Ruth
insisted that her heavy wool dress be made of
the Stuart plaid. She then had a tam o&#8217;shanter
designed from the same Scotch tartan. But
Ruth&#8217;s proudest possession was a short Norfolk
jacket made of the same leather as her leggins,
and a knapsack to carry over her shoulders.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
Attired in her woodland costume, she
looked not unlike &#8220;Rosalind&#8221; in Shakespeare&#8217;s
play, when that maid comes into the woods disguised
as a boy to seek for her father.
</p>
<p>Barbara&#8217;s suit was of dark brown corduroy,
with jacket and cap to match. Grace would
choose nothing but her favorite dark blue. But
her costume was the most striking of them all,
for, with her blue skirt and blouse, she was to
wear a coat of hunter&#8217;s pink and a smart, little
hat of the same bright scarlet shade. Mr.
Stuart selected the costume for Mistress Mollie.
She at least, he insisted, should be arrayed
in the proper shade of Lincoln green; and
like a veritable &#8220;Maid Marian&#8221; she appeared.
</p>
<p>For once Miss Sallie was entirely satisfied
with their selection of costumes. &#8220;For me,&#8221;
she argued in her most decided manner, &#8220;the
most necessary garments are half a dozen pairs
of overshoes, and the same number of mackintoshes
and umbrellas. I shall also take an extra
trunk of warm flannels. If the fall rains
begin while we are camping in the mountains
we shall surely be washed down into the valley
before we can make our escape.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>IN THE HEART OF THE BERKSHIRES</h3>
</div>

<p>A crimson automobile was climbing the
steep inclines of the Berkshire Hills.
Now it rose to the crest of a road.
Again it dipped into a valley. It looked like a
scarlet autumn leaf blown down from one of the
giant forest trees that guarded the slopes of the
mountains.
</p>
<p>Mollie Thurston stood up in the back of the
motor car, waving a long green veil.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the scenery just too perfect for
words?&#8221; she called to Ruth.
</p>
<p>The day was wonderful; the September sun
shone warm and golden through the shadows
of dancing, many-colored leaves. &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; had left summer behind them in
Kingsbridge. Three days of traveling found
them in the early autumn glory of the Berkshire
woods.
</p>
<p>Ruth did not answer Mollie&#8217;s question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, wake up!&#8221; commanded
Miss Sallie, leaning over to give her niece a
gentle poke with her violet parasol. &#8220;Have
you grown suddenly deaf? Can you not hear
when you are spoken to?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>Ruth glanced up from her steering wheel.
&#8220;Did some one speak to me?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;I
am so sorry I did not hear. I am afraid I am
both deaf and dumb to-day. But we simply
must get to our mountain by noon. Driving
a car over these mountain roads isn&#8217;t the easiest
task in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara laughed back over her shoulder at
the occupants of the end seat in the car. &#8220;Miss
Sallie Stuart,&#8221; she said in solemn tones,
&#8220;please, let our chauffeur alone! Suppose the
dark descends upon us in the woods and you
have &#8216;nary&#8217; a place to lay your head!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should immediately find a hotel and
ask for a room and a bath,&#8221; protested Miss
Stuart, who did not favor the idea of the log
cabin in the woods. &#8220;Remember, children,
you may pretend as hard as you like that we
are a thousand miles from civilization; but, unless
we are perfectly comfortable in the woods,
I shall take you to the best hotel in Lenox.
From there you may do your mountaineering in
a respectable way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the more need for you to hurry, Ruth,&#8221;
whispered Bab in her friend&#8217;s ear. &#8220;I feel
sure we shall find the guides and wagons waiting
for us at the foot of the hill. If we get an
early enough start up the mountain we can get
fairly settled by night time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Ruth nodded with her eyes straight in front of
her. She kept her car moving swiftly ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara, it is quite idle to talk to Ruth,&#8221;
broke in Miss Sallie, who had not heard just
what Bab had said. &#8220;She is her father&#8217;s
daughter. Once her mind is made up to accomplish
a thing, she will do it or die! So we might
as well resign ourselves to our fate. She will
reach &#8216;her mountain,&#8217; as she calls it, by noon,
even if we have to jump a few of these embankments
to succeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie was growing tired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did I ever allow myself to be brought
on such a wild expedition after the experiences
you girls led me into in Newport!&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Sallie!&#8221; said Grace Carter gently&mdash;Grace
was always the peacemaker&mdash;&#8220;you know
you love these glorious woods as much as we do.
Think how jolly things will be when we go down
into Lenox after it grows too cold to stay in
camp. Who knows but you will turn out the
best sportsman in the lot? And we shall probably
have our guide teach you to shoot before we
are through this trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart sniffed indignantly. Then she
laughed at the thought of her plump fingers pulling
the trigger of a gun. &#8220;What is our guide&#8217;s
outlandish name?&#8221; she inquired in milder tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki, and his wife is called Ceally,&#8221; Grace
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
answered. &#8220;You remember Mr. Stuart explained
they were originally French Canadians,
but they have been living in these mountains for
a number of years. Because they used to be
guides up in the Canadian forests they don&#8217;t
know any other trade to follow in these peaceful
woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These woods were by no means always
peaceful, my lady Grace!&#8221; asserted Bab. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t even be perfectly sure they are peaceful
now. Why,&#8221; she went on in thrilling tones,
&#8220;these hillsides once ran red with the blood of
our ancestors and of the friendly Indian tribes
who fought with them against the French.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come! come! No more American history!&#8221;
remarked Mollie. &#8220;Beg pardon, but I
do object to Bab&#8217;s school-teacher manner. Did
you ever see anything so lovely as these hills are
now? The scenery around here is like the enchanted
forests of Arcady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Sallie, girls, look!&#8221; called Grace.
From the high crest of a hill &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; gazed down upon one of the loveliest valleys
in the Berkshires. Afar off they could see
the narrow Housatonic River winding its way
past villages and fields, from the hillsides, which
gave it the Indian name; for Housatonic means
&#8220;a stream over the mountains.&#8221; Nestling in
the valleys lay a chain of silver lakes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Ruth paused an instant. &#8220;Over there ahead
of us is &#8216;our mountain.&#8217; I think we can reach
it in an hour or so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While they were pursuing their journey,
another small party was gathering on the slope
of the hill opposite. A long, lean man burned to
the color and texture of leather sat on the front
seat of a wagon drawn by two strong mountain
horses. By his side was his wife, almost as thin
and brown; behind them, piled up in the wagon,
were trunks, rolls of steamer rugs, kitchen utensils,
making altogether as odd an assortment of
goods as if the couple were peddlers.
</p>
<p>Strolling around near them was a younger
man, evidently the driver of a well filled grocery
wagon. His horse stood patiently cropping the
fine, hillside grass. Farther up the roadside a
chauffeur nibbled a spear of mint. He had no
car near him, but his costume was unmistakable.
Evidently something was in the air. Somebody
or something was being waited for.
</p>
<p>Soon after twelve o&#8217;clock, there was a whirr
along the road. The cart horses raised their ears,
and without a motion from their drivers, moved
farther to the right side of the path. Berkshire
Hills horses, in whatever station of life, needed
no further notice. An automobile was approaching!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; cried the grocer&#8217;s boy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
jumping back into his wagon. The chauffeur
dropped his piece of mint and gazed down the
road. Now at least there was something worth
seeing!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hip! hip! hurrah!&#8221; &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; landed with a flourish beside the wagons.
Their laughter woke the sleeping echoes in the
hills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Naki and Ceally?&#8221; cried Ruth,
jumping out of the car and running forward
with her hand extended. &#8220;And are these our
things you have in the wagon? I am so sorry
we are a few minutes late; but these mountain
roads take longer to drive over than I had expected.
I hope I haven&#8217;t kept you waiting very
long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; said the guide, sliding slowly down
from his perch on the camping outfit. He
emptied the pipe he had been comfortably smoking.
&#8220;Time enough,&#8221; he answered. Naki was
a man of few words.
</p>
<p>The chauffeur had walked over to Ruth&#8217;s car
and was assisting Miss Sallie to descend. &#8220;You
are to take this car into Lenox, I believe,&#8221; Miss
Stuart began. &#8220;My niece will explain matters
to you more fully. I am told we cannot take the
car any further up this side of the hill. Where
is the carriage in which we are to drive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Sallie!&#8221; cried Ruth in consternation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
&#8220;What are we to do? When Naki wrote
there would be seats in his wagon for those of us
who wished to drive up the hill, I am afraid he
meant those seats in front by him and his wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The guide looked perfectly solemn, even when
he beheld Miss Sallie&#8217;s face. Imagine, if you
can, Miss Sallie Stuart, nervous, as she was,
perched on top of a rickety wagon! Add the
fact that she was to be driven up an unexplored
hillside by the side of the two queer, brown people
to whom they were confiding their fates!
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t ride &#8217;longside of you, Miss,&#8221; explained
Naki to Ruth. &#8220;I leads the horses up
and my wife walks by their side. There&#8217;s room
for three of you up there on the front seat. It&#8217;s
more comfortable than it looks. The other two
of you had better walk or you can ride in the
grocery wagon. The man&#8217;s coming along behind
us with the provisions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie had not spoken again. Her expression
was that of a martyr.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you can manage, Miss Sallie?&#8221;
Bab pleaded.
</p>
<p>Ruth was explaining matters to the chauffeur.
He was to take the car to Lenox. Every afternoon
at one o&#8217;clock he was to return with it to
this fork in the road and wait for half an hour.
If &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; decided on a trip to
one of the nearby towns, they would join him at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
this place; for here the good road ended and the
trail up the hillside began. The camp was a
long way from any town, but an automobile
defies distance.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart looked truly miserable when she
saw their car disappear down the foot of the hill.
Then she looked around her carefully. The
place was entirely deserted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she declared, resignedly. &#8220;I
suppose there is nothing for me to do but to
climb up into that wretched wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth, Barbara, Grace, Mollie, Naki and his
wife all assisted her to mount over the wheel to
the seat of honor. Violet cushions were piled
back of her, Grace sat on one side of her, Mollie
on the other. Ruth and Barbara were determined
to walk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are dreadfully tired sitting still, Aunt
Sallie,&#8221; Ruth begged. &#8220;Please let us follow
the wagon!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, you can walk if you are able. In
fact, you have no way to ride except in the grocery
wagon, where you would probably get
mixed up with the pickles and preserves,&#8221; responded
Miss Stuart. &#8220;Walk by all means!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cavalcade started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pretend,&#8221; proposed Bab to Ruth,
&#8220;that we are starting out on what the Indians
called &#8216;the long walk.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, Bab, it&#8217;s a long walk, all right. But
why introduce the Indians?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were climbing up the steep path
ahead of the wagon. Bab laughed. &#8220;Oh, I
read somewhere,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;that the
Indians used to sell their land that way. Suppose
you and I were early settlers, who were
trying to purchase this hillside from the
Indians. They would tell us we could have, for
a fixed sum, as much land as we could cover in
the &#8216;long walk.&#8217; That would mean that we were
to walk along quietly from sunrise to sunset, sitting
down occasionally to smoke a pipe of peace,
to break bread, and to drink water. That reminds
me, are we ever going to break bread
again? I am starving!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth was not sympathetic at the moment.
&#8220;It is curious,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;These
mountains are so full of Indian legends, we shall
think, hear and dream of nothing but Indians in
the next few weeks. The names of all the places
around were once Indian. I suppose we shall
do almost everything except see an Indian.
The last of them has vanished from here. Oh,
Bab, do look at Aunt Sallie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart had forgotten her fright. Fortunately,
she did not realize how absurd she appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth!&#8221; she called from her throne on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
wagon seat. &#8220;Here is a perfectly good place for
our lunch. There is water near and view
enough, I am sure. I must be given food before
I am taken another step up these hills. I am
famished!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The party found a clear space in the woods.
In a short time Naki had built a fire of pine
twigs, and Ceally had a giant pot of coffee boiling
over it. Its delicious perfume mingled with
the fresh mountain air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare I haven&#8217;t been so hungry since I
was a girl,&#8221; Miss Sallie avowed. She was
seated on a log, with a sandwich in one hand and
a cup of coffee on the ground by her. Her hat
was on one side of her head, and her pompadour
drooped dejectedly, but Miss Sallie was blissfully
unconscious. The color in her cheeks shone
as fresh and rosy as the tints in the cheeks of
any other of &#8220;The Automobile Girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie flitted around like the spirit of the
woods. Nothing could induce her to keep still.
&#8220;Do let me get the water,&#8221; she coaxed the guide.
Like a flash she was off and back bearing a heavy
bucket. &#8220;Here, Ruth,&#8221; she volunteered, pouring
a stream of water into the tiny silver cup
that Ruth always carried. Ruth was just in
time. With a jump to one side, she escaped, but
the splash descended on unsuspecting Bab, who
Was nibbling a doughnut.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>In her ardor at playing waitress in the woods
Mollie had turned her bucket upside down. Instead
of dispensing nectar, this little cup-bearer
to &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; had nearly drowned
one of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blessed thing you are my sister,&#8221; cried
Bab.
</p>
<p>Mollie apologized, dabbing at Bab with
her small pocket handkerchief. &#8220;You can tell
me exactly what you think of me. Ruth and
Grace might be too polite. I am so sorry; I was
trying to be useful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over to the fire, Barbara, and dry your
dress,&#8221; advised Miss Sallie. &#8220;It is just as well
you have on a thick suit. We must learn to expect
occasional mishaps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara winked solemnly at Ruth as she arose
from the table. Miss Sallie was sure to be in a
good humor when she talked in this philosophical
fashion.
</p>
<p>For an hour after luncheon the camping party
continued their climb. Finally Ruth and Bab,
who were in front, came to a sudden stop.
&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; they shouted, turning to wave their
handkerchiefs to the occupants of the wagon.
</p>
<p>Mollie nearly pitched out of the wagon in her
excitement, but Grace and Miss Sallie clutched
at her skirts in time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we arrived?&#8221; Mollie cried. &#8220;Oh, do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
stop the wagon!&#8221; The little log cabin in the
woods was now plainly in view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the gingerbread house, I know it is,&#8221;
exclaimed Grace, making a flying leap over the
wheel of the cart. &#8220;The logs are the soft,
brown color of good gingerbread, and the little
windows must be made of sugar frosting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a clearing on top of a hillside stood the
&#8220;hut,&#8221; as the girls christened it in an instant. A
circle of pine and cedar trees hid it from sight.
All around it were thick woods. Higher hills
rose at the back of it. A roaring brook tumbled
down the hillside fifty feet from their cabin door.
</p>
<p>By nightfall the little house in the woods was
made thoroughly livable. The girls hammered
and worked, assisted by Naki and his wife. Miss
Sallie sat by the big fire in the living room and
gave directions. Adjoining this big room, which
ran across one side of the cabin, were two bedrooms.
Farther back Naki and Ceally shared a
small chamber that connected with the kitchen.
</p>
<p>Just before supper time Ruth took Miss Sallie
by the arm; Grace, Barbara and Mollie followed
them; around and around their new home
&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; marched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See your elegance!&#8221; said Ruth to her aunt,
pointing to a mirror, which hung by a nail over
Miss Sallie&#8217;s rough pine wood dressing table.
Her favorite toilet articles were already laid out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
upon it, her wrapper hung over the back of a
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most noble lady,&#8221; continued Ruth, &#8220;behold
what miracles your willing slaves have performed
for your comfort! Everything is here
for your convenience except your perfumed
bath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of a bath, child!&#8221; cried Miss
Sallie, with a real shudder of horror. &#8220;It is the
lack of a proper bathtub that makes this camping
business truly awful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Miss Sallie,&#8221; called Barbara, quick to
change the subject. &#8220;I want you to see the wonderful
sunset.&#8221; Overhead Miss Sallie beheld a
golden radiance that bathed the hilltop in a wonderful
light. In the west the sun was sinking
behind a line of blue mountains.
</p>
<p>That evening the girls sat around an open
campfire piled high with pine logs. It was a
cool night, and although they were tired, no one
would suggest going in to bed. Every now and
then Mollie would tumble forward and awake
with a start. She was half listening, half
dreaming as Grace&#8217;s lovely voice floated out
through the still night air, singing, while she
strummed idly her guitar:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Lovely moon that softly glides,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Mollie to Grace, as she
finally followed her into bed, &#8220;what wonderful
adventures we shall have in this forest? Perhaps
we shall awaken a wood nymph and teach
her to become a mortal maid. Do you suppose
she would like the change?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A DAY IN THE WOODS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mollie crept to the door of their hut at
sunrise next morning. She thought
she heard light footfalls outside their
door. The other girls were fast asleep, worn
out by the long trip of the day before. Yet
when Mollie peeped outside no one was in sight;
all was silence.
</p>
<p>Only the birds had begun to stir in their nests
and call their morning greetings across from
one tree top to another. As far as Mollie could
see stretched the unbroken forest. A narrow
path ran down the hill between the trees. A
steeper incline rose back of them and this was
broken with deep ravines. Mollie could neither
see nor hear anyone. Yet it seemed to her that
she was not alone. She had a sense of some
unknown presence.
</p>
<p>She crept back into the room and put on her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
crimson dressing gown and slippers. She was
bent on making a discovery. It could not be
Naki or his wife, whose light footfalls she had
heard moving swiftly around the house. They
were nowhere to be seen. She was nervous
about going out, as Miss Sallie had made dreadful
suggestions about wolves and wild cats, yet
she slipped out on the tiny porch. Far away
through the trees and up the steep hillside she
saw flying like a deer, a thin, brown creature.
Was it human or a sprite? Mollie could not
guess. She caught a glimpse of it, but it had
been impossible to observe it accurately, so fast
it flew. There was only a whirr of flying feet,
and a flash of brown and scarlet to be seen.
Could it be the famous ghost of Lost Man&#8217;s
Trail?
</p>
<p>At this same moment Naki came around
from the back of the house. &#8220;I thought I
heard some one,&#8221; he grumbled, looking suspiciously
at Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so did I,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And I saw
some one or something fly up the steep side of
that hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki did not answer. Mollie thought he
looked at her queerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have been mistaken, Miss,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;Nothing could have gone up that
ravine over yonder. There&#8217;s only an Indian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
trail back there. Nobody travels much over
that hill. It&#8217;s all cliffs and dangerous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie shook her pretty head. She did not
argue, but she knew what she had seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to try climbing it, some day,
just the same,&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;but of
course, I must get used to finding my way about
first. I must find out just what I saw this
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Mollie?&#8221; asked
Grace, opening her eyes as Mollie came back
to bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; called Ruth from the next
room, where she slept with Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; Mollie answered, fearful of
being thought superstitious. &#8220;I thought I
heard a sound at the door, but I was mistaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; Ruth demanded later, as they sat
over their breakfast, &#8220;is there anything in the
world so good to eat as bacon fried by Ceally
over an open fire?&#8221; Ruth helped herself to
all that was left on the dish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth Stuart!&#8221; called Barbara. &#8220;How dare
you take all the bacon, when you have just declared
it was so delicious? Miss Sallie, make
her divide with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart looked up from her eggs and
toast: &#8220;What are you children quarreling
about?&#8221; she asked placidly. &#8220;Suppose you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
bring us another dish of bacon, Ceally. The
mountain air certainly creates an appetite. I
am sure I don&#8217;t see what benefit I am to get
from &#8216;roughing it!&#8217; The one thing I hoped to
do by living outdoors was to reduce my figure,
but, if my appetite continues at the present
rate, I shall certainly not lose an ounce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you be too sure, auntie,&#8221; Ruth demurred.
&#8220;Wait till we get through with you
to-day. Think you can climb the hill back of
us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie interrupted. &#8220;Naki warns us against
that particular hill. He says it is unpopular
for climbing because of its cliffs and ravines.
But he hints that there is an Indian trail over
it, so I am dying to explore it. Aren&#8217;t you,
Bab?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not for me!&#8221; laughed Ruth hastily.
&#8220;I am not any too devoted to scaling cliffs,
you may remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the programme for to-day?&#8221; Grace
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody must go down the hill with me
this afternoon,&#8221; Ruth answered. &#8220;The automobile
is to meet us there you know, to take
us to a postoffice to mail our letters to our beloved
families. This morning we can just poke
round the camp. I want Naki to teach us how
to make a camp fire.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Mollie looked down at her dainty hands.
&#8220;It is rather dirty work, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it, Mollie,&#8221; put in Bab. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be finicky, or we shall put you out of camp.
It&#8217;s a good thing to know how to build a first-class
fire. Suppose one of us should be lost in
the woods some day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will suppose no such thing,&#8221; protested
Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon Miss Sallie and the
four girls started down the hill. Bab, Mollie
and Miss Stuart were to go only a part of the
way with Ruth and Grace, the two girls continuing
their walk until they met the chauffeur,
who was to bring the motor car up to the point
of the road where Ruth had told him to meet
her.
</p>
<p>Mollie and Bab begged off from the excursion.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know,&#8221; Bab argued,
&#8220;how near we still are to civilization. If I go
to town with you to-day, no matter how long
the drive is, it will take away a part of the
romance of living in the hills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart was not much of a walker. Before
they had gone half a mile she decided that
it was high time to turn back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye girls,&#8221; she called to Ruth and
Grace, who were hurrying on. &#8220;Do not stay
too late. You must be back by dusk, or I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
be most uneasy. At five-thirty I shall expect
you in camp. These are my orders.&#8221; Miss
Sallie turned to Bab and Mollie. &#8220;Seriously,
children,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;I think I shall establish
military rules. If one of you stays out
after dusk, I believe I shall shut you up in the
guard house for twenty-four hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where is the guard house please, Miss
Sallie?&#8221; inquired Mollie meekly.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie laughed. &#8220;In this case the guard
house means only the cabin. The girl who
fails to appear when the roll is called in the
evening must remain within the limits of the
camp all the following day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab and Mollie left Miss Stuart before the
log fire in the living room of their hut. Miss
Sallie, who had a taste for romance in the lives
of other people, was deep in the reading of a
new novel. A part of the camping supplies had
been a collection of new books for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Mollie,&#8221; cried Bab gayly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go over in the woods and gather some pine and
cedar branches for our fire this evening.&#8221;
Barbara walked ahead, pulling a small wagon
behind her with all the ardor of a young boy.
&#8220;You see,&#8221; she avowed to Mollie, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
have to remember I am sixteen, or a girl, while
we are living in the woods. I can be just as
independent as I like.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The two sisters were deep in their task.
The little wagon was piled high with evergreens.
Suddenly Mollie started. She thought
she heard a voice calling from somewhere
above their heads. &#8220;Hi, there! Hello!
Hello!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear some one calling?&#8221; asked
Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; responded Barbara. &#8220;What
is the matter with you, Mollie? This morning
you heard a &#8216;spook&#8217; outside the door, this afternoon
you believe you hear a voice calling you.
Beware, child! Perhaps you are already afflicted
with the wood madness, and may see that
wonderful ghost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, there! Hi, there!&#8221; A voice was surely
floating down from the sky.
</p>
<p>This time Bab stared. Mollie looked triumphant.
As far as they could see around
them, there was no other human creature. And
the sound did not come from the ground. Mollie
was right. The noise was from overhead.
But it was so far off and faint, it could not
come from the trees above them.
</p>
<p>Bab and Mollie ran out into an open space.
There was a strange, rattling, swinging noise
above their heads, as though a pair of mammoth
wings were beating in the sky. The two girls
looked up. There, about twenty yards above
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
the tops of the highest trees was the strangest
object ever seen by Mollie and Bab!
</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is it?&#8221; Bab breathed faintly.
The voice sounded more distinctly this time.
&#8220;Is there some one down there in the woods?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab caught the words. The sound was coming
from a megaphone from the strange ship
in the air. But Mollie and Bab had no megaphone
at their command through which to answer
back&mdash;only two frightened girl voices.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; they called together as loud as
they could shout. The sound was ridiculous
even to their own ears, and was lost in the vast
spaces of the forest. The strange vehicle over
their heads was gliding a little closer to the
ground. Bab and Mollie could faintly see the
figure of a man&mdash;two men&mdash;when they looked
again.
</p>
<p>This time the voice came through the megaphone:
&#8220;Can you get me help? I have broken
the rudder of my balloon. We cannot alight
without assistance. If we come too close to the
ground we will catch in the trees. I want some
one to pull us down with ropes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mollie spoke to herself, &#8220;it is a relief
to know that that object is an airship, not
some hideous hobgoblin. I would like to know,
Bab, how you and I are to get the thing to the
ground?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Run, fly, Molliekins!&#8221; cried Bab, whose mind
was always quick in action. &#8220;Go to the cabin
for Naki and Ceally. Tell them to come here
as fast as they can tear. We can manage together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie was off in a flash.
</p>
<p>Barbara&#8217;s voice could now be heard by the
men in the balloon above her. &#8220;Drop me a
line,&#8221; she called to them, &#8220;before you float too
far away. I will tie you to a tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab had realized that with a broken rudder it
was impossible for the dirigible balloon to remain
poised in the air.
</p>
<p>A long coil of rope floated down from the sky.
Barbara caught it and ran to a tree which was
bare of branches. Then she knotted the rope
with all her skill and strength. There was nothing
to do, now, but wait. Bab fastened her gaze
upon the strange white bird she had captured,
which hung fluttering and quivering in the sky
above her.

<h3>&#8220;THE GREAT WHITE ALSO&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Two minutes later Naki came running
along the path. Even his solemn face
was aglow with excitement. Ceally was
close behind him. Just after them danced Mollie,
who was followed by Miss Sallie. The latter
had deserted her novel at the critical
moment of the story. She must discover what
Mollie was talking about. The child was too excited
to explain.
</p>

</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>When the little party reached the clearing
where Bab stood it was easy to see what had
happened. An aerial navigator had come to
grief and was calling for assistance.
</p>
<p>As Naki joined Bab, the aeronauts dropped
more ropes from their basket, which hung beneath
the great balloon. The big guide seized
hold of one; his wife grabbed another; before
Miss Sallie could stop her, Bab was swinging on
a third.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great heavens child, let go!&#8221; Miss Sallie
called out in tones of intense alarm. &#8220;You will
be rising up in the air in another moment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; laughed Bab out of breath.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger now. Don&#8217;t you smell
something horrible?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The delicious air of the woods was being permeated
with a detestable odor. The great balloon
above their heads was shrinking. It was
growing smaller and smaller. The gas was being
allowed slowly to escape from it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it looks like an enormous slug,&#8221; cried
Mollie, &#8220;now that we can see the thing closely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the balloon had neared the
ground. Two men sprang over the sides of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
basket, both alighting on their feet. Half a moment
later the older of the two was bowing
politely to Miss Sallie and wiping his glasses.
Landing from a balloon on top of a mountain
was apparently an ordinary occurrence with him.
His companion was busy with the airship, which
now lay on one side on the ground. It was
shuddering and exhaling deep breaths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said the aeronaut addressing Miss
Sallie, but looking at Barbara, who stood by her
side. &#8220;More than I can express I thank you for
your assistance. We were, I think, in rather a
dangerous position and we might very easily
have been killed. At best, in trying to alight
without help, I should have torn my balloon in
the branches of the trees. Perhaps you ladies
would like to examine the balloon more thoroughly.
This is my nephew, Reginald
Latham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A young man arose from the ground. He
wore a close fitting tan costume, a cap with a
visor and short trousers.
</p>
<p>He brought his heels together with a click,
and bowed low to Miss Sallie. Then he extended
his hand to Mollie and Barbara. &#8220;It was immensely
clever of you,&#8221; he spoke, with a slightly
foreign accent, &#8220;to have helped us out of our
difficulty. Tying us to the tree, while we were
obliged to wait, really saved the situation. I do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
not think the balloon is injured at all, except for
the broken rudder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man spoke of his balloon as tenderly
as though it were a cherished friend. He
looked about twenty-three or four years old. He
was thin and dark, with clever eyes; but an expression
of restlessness and discontent spoiled
an otherwise interesting face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Winthrop Latham,&#8221; his uncle continued.
&#8220;I have a summer place down here, but
my nephew and I spend most of our time, both
summer and winter in Lenox. We have a house
in my grounds where we are both working on
models for airships.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham paused. It was natural that he
should expect some explanation. What was a
handsome, middle-aged woman doing on top of
a mountain? Why were her only companions
two charming young girls and a rough looking
man and his wife?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Miss Stuart replied, laughing,
&#8220;that you are almost as much surprised at our
appearance as we are at yours! I am sure no
thanks are necessary for our part in your rescue!
We were delighted to assist in such a novel and
up-to-date adventure.&#8221; Miss Sallie looked
smilingly at Mollie and Barbara. She was
rather enjoying their unusual experience. Moreover,
she had heard of Mr. Latham&#8217;s beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
home in Lenox. And was assured they were in
the best of company.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are camping on this hill for a few
weeks,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I am Miss Stuart, of
Chicago. My niece and I, and three girl friends,
are the entire camping party, except for our
guide and his wife. Won&#8217;t you come to our hut?
Can we be of any assistance to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you can!&#8221; heartily declared Mr.
Latham, who was evidently an old bachelor of
about fifty-five years of age, with charming manners.
&#8220;I wonder if you will take care of my
balloon for me until my nephew can get down
the hill to send a wagon up for it. That very
inferior looking object you now see collapsed on
the ground is really my latest treasure. It is
one of the best dirigible balloons invented up to
the present time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara was already down on her hands and
knees beside the balloon. As her new acquaintance
explained the details of its construction to
her, his face burned with enthusiasm. Mollie,
watching him, thought he looked almost handsome.
Nevertheless she didn&#8217;t like Reginald
Latham. Bab, however, was delighted. She
had a thirst for information and here was a
young man who could intelligently talk to her
about the most marvelous inventions of the century,
the airship and the aeroplane.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Bab volunteered, &#8220;if the balloon
can be folded without harming it, we might
carry it to the house in our small express wagon.
We could each hold up a side of it, and it would
be better than carrying it altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The queer procession started for the cabin.
Miss Sallie and Mollie walked on in front. Mr.
Latham, Reginald Latham, Naki and Ceally,
each supported a corner of the balloon, while
Bab solemnly dragged the express wagon. Her
pile of evergreens had been rudely dumped out
on the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for goodness sake!&#8221; Ruth and Grace
stood at the door of their cabin, transfixed with
surprise. &#8220;What on earth has happened this
time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let nothing surprise you, girls, in this world
of strange adventure,&#8221; called Barbara. She had
forgotten the strangers when she saw the amazed
faces of Ruth and Grace. &#8220;Sometimes it is the
stay-at-homes who have the exciting experiences
come to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do come in and have tea with us, Mr.
Latham!&#8221; urged Miss Stuart. &#8220;Naki will go
down to a farmhouse, only a mile or so away,
where he keeps his horses, and will bring up his
wagon to take your balloon home for you. You
really must explain matters to my niece and her
friend, Miss Carter, or they will perish with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
curiosity! If traveling in the air makes one as
hungry as living on a hilltop, the tea may be
acceptable for its own sake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I want to come into your castle,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Latham. &#8220;I feel so certain I have
run across a party of fairies that I must peep
into your dwelling to see if you are real people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not ahead of us, Mr. Latham,&#8221;
laughed Barbara, &#8220;Mollie and I thought you
were angels calling down to us from the sky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Miss Stuart,&#8221; begged their visitor,
as he was making his adieus, &#8220;that you will
soon come down from your high retreat and
bring these young ladies to see my place in
Lenox. Reginald and I promise not to talk airships
incessantly. But, if you refuse to descend
the hill very soon, my nephew and I shall climb
up to see you. Next time I promise to appear
in a more conventional fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night, when the girls were undressing,
Mollie announced unexpectedly: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
that Reginald Latham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Mollie?&#8221; asked Bab. &#8220;He is a
very interesting fellow. His mother is a German
and he has been educated in Germany. His
father, who was Mr. Latham&#8217;s younger brother,
is dead. I think Reginald is his uncle&#8217;s heir.
He told me he and his uncle mean to devote all
their time to inventing airships. He studied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
about them in Germany, even before he came
to live with his uncle three years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; Mollie ejaculated. &#8220;Then he is
even more queer than I thought him. What a
useless life for a man of his age. I don&#8217;t like
him even if he is ever so clever, and though his
uncle is a dear. Girls, if I tell you something
will you promise me not to laugh? Cross your
heart and body. I won&#8217;t tell you unless you
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then we have no choice, Mollie,&#8221; laughed
Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may laugh a little,&#8221; relented Mollie, who
was giggling softly to herself. &#8220;Do you know
what I suddenly thought, when Bab and I saw
that great white object come sailing over our
heads this afternoon? Like a flash it popped
into my mind. Here comes &#8216;The Great White
Also!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara shrieked with laughter in spite of her
promise. &#8220;Oh, you funny Mollie!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the child talking about?&#8221; inquired
the puzzled Ruth. &#8220;The Great White Also!
What utter nonsense!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie blushed. &#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; she
asked, &#8220;a paragraph in the first geography you
studied at school? It read: &#8216;The brown bear,
the black bear, and the great white also inhabit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
the northern regions of North America.&#8217; Well,
when I was small child I always thought &#8216;the
great white also&#8217; was some strange kind of animal.
For a long time I wondered and wondered
what it could be. Finally I asked mother and
Bab to explain the sentence to me. Of course
they thought it a lovely joke; but, just the same,
I never could get over my first impression. It
flashed into my head this afternoon, when I saw
that strange white thing struggling in the air&mdash;at
last here comes &#8216;The Great White Also!&#8217;
Wasn&#8217;t it too absurd? I have been laughing to
myself ever since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Children, what on earth is the matter?&#8221; inquired
Miss Sallie, appearing at the bedroom
door in her dressing gown. &#8220;You will waken
the dead with your racket. Ruth, come to bed,
at once, and tell me what you are laughing
about.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MOLLIE FOLLOWS THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mollie have you seen my red sweater?&#8221;
called Grace a few days later. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t find it anywhere; yet I am sure I
left it out here on this bench last night. Naki
and Ceally haven&#8217;t seen it. Horrid thing! It
has taken wings and flown away just when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
wanted it. Do come with us. Ruth, Bab and I
are going over into the forest to try to learn to
shoot. Naki is to teach us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Miss Sallie know?&#8221; asked Mollie, who
was not in a good humor. Bab had been lecturing
her for her sudden dislike of Reginald
Latham. It seemed to Mistress Barbara unreasonable
that Mollie had taken such an unaccountable
prejudice against a young man whom
they had barely met.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk, Mollie, as if he were a villain in a
play,&#8221; Bab protested.
</p>
<p>Mollie knew she had been obstinate. All she
had answered was: &#8220;Well, he would probably be
a villain, if he had the opportunity. I hope I
shan&#8217;t see him again. I don&#8217;t see, Bab, why
you should be so interested in him. He&#8217;s lots
older than you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not interested in him,&#8221; Bab retorted
indignantly. And the two sisters had separated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Miss Sallie knows we are going to
practise shooting?&#8221; mimicked Grace. &#8220;What is
the matter with Miss Mollie Thurston this morning?
Don&#8217;t you know Mr. Stuart sent us a rifle.
He told us learning to shoot might prove a useful
part of our education. <i>Do</i> come on with us
Mollie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; Mollie declared. &#8220;I hate
the noise of a gun. Oh, I am not afraid, Grace
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
Carter, so you needn&#8217;t tease; but I prefer more
ladylike amusements. I am going for a walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go too far by yourself, Mollie,&#8221; pleaded
Grace, who didn&#8217;t mind Mollie&#8217;s tantrums.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know your way about these hills, yet,
and it isn&#8217;t safe to wander any distance. How
I wish I could find my coat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take Aunt Sallie&#8217;s,&#8221; cried Ruth, appearing
suddenly in the doorway. &#8220;It is not such
a charming color as your scarlet one, and it may
be a trifle large, but it will keep you warm.
Coming, child?&#8221; she asked Mollie.
</p>
<p>Mollie shook her head. Without waiting for
Bab to join them she started on her walk. The
child wanted to be alone. Besides being in a
bad humor she had several things to think about.
She certainly would not tell Bab and the other
girls, just to be laughed at; but again that morning
she had heard a light noise outside their
window. It didn&#8217;t sound like an animal. Mollie
wrinkled her pretty forehead, and a puzzled expression
crept into her blue eyes. How absurd
even to dream of a thief, here on their beautiful
hillside far away from the rest of the world.
And, she, a great girl of fourteen, knew better
than to believe in ghosts.
</p>
<p>Mollie slipped down the path and crossed the
gully that divided the nearer hill from the
higher one back of it. Already her bad humor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
was disappearing. She had no idea of going
far from their cabin; another day she might persuade
the girls to explore this mysterious hill,
with its lost Indian trail; but she should not attempt
it alone. This morning she wanted only
to creep away for an hour or so into the woodland
quiet.
</p>
<p>Mollie Thurston had a curious passion for the
woods. When she was alone in them she would
stand still a long time, calling to the birds, and
she delighted in having them steal near and
shyly listen to the sweet sounds she made in return
for theirs. No one knew of this accomplishment
of Mollie&#8217;s, not even Bab.
</p>
<p>Up the steep hillside Mollie clambered. Below
her she could hear the pop, pop, pop, of a
rifle. The girls were evidently taking their lesson
in target practice from Naki.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am fairly safe up here,&#8221; Mollie
chuckled, &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t care to be too near
those shooting experts. I know they will hit
everything near them except their target.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat down on the root of an old tree that
jutted out from an overhanging bank, and drew
a sheet of paper from her pocket. She would
write to her mother of their rescue of an airship.
Mollie bit the end of her pencil&mdash;she was
not in a writing mood. Why had she taken such
a dislike to Reginald Latham? He had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
polite enough, and was rather good-looking. It
was Bab&#8217;s habit to feel prejudices, not hers.
She wouldn&#8217;t say anything to her mother about
him, but certainly Bab seemed to like him unusually
well.
</p>
<p>Crack! Crack! The sound came from the
bushes! She looked quickly around. It must
have been a gust of wind that stirred. In
another minute there tumbled over her head a
shower of leaves and acorns, that for an instant
blinded her. But she could hear plainly this
time; light feet were running along the bank
above the ravine where she sat.
</p>
<p>Without pausing a moment she jumped to her
feet and ran up the path that led from the bottom
of the ravine to the hilltop. Nothing was
in sight; but further on through a thicket of
trees, she caught the distant sound of flying footsteps.
She could see the underbrush move, as
though shaken by something in passing.
</p>
<p>A shivering sense of mystery possessed the
girl. Could it be the ghost?
</p>
<p>Without stopping to think Mollie flew in pursuit;
determined to discover what had disturbed
her. Once she saw a bright object flash ahead
of her, brown and scarlet, through the trees. It
was gone in an instant. Surely it was but a
shadow from the autumn leaves.
</p>
<p>For some distance Mollie had been following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
what seemed to be a pathway through a tangled
thicket of bushes and trees. Suddenly she
stopped. So far as she could see the path ended
abruptly. Yet, at this very moment, she heard
a faint hallo!
</p>
<p>It was the voice of temptation to Mollie, and
she let her curiosity get the better of her. Without
in the least knowing where she was going
she pushed on. Ducking her head through an
opening in one place, turning and twisting
wherever she found it possible to make her way,
the child came at last into a thick forest. On
every side of her stretched endless avenues of
trees. Now no sound of flying feet urged her
on; no voice called her.
</p>
<p>Poor Mollie was entirely alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What an utter goose I am!&#8221; she declared
out loud. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever heard anyone,
or saw anything. It was just my imagination
that led me on. Now, I hope,&#8221; Mollie gave
a rueful smile and sat down to pull the brambles
out of her dress, &#8220;I hope my imagination will
kindly show me the way home again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Which way should she go? There were half
a dozen different directions open to her. Which
was the right one?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; thought Mollie, &#8220;if, somehow, I
have struck the famous &#8216;Lost Man&#8217;s Trail?&#8217; It
is a lost girl&#8217;s trail all right!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>She turned this way, then that. In front of
her between the sumach and the holly trees was
an open space, which might lead somewhere toward
home. Mollie pushed her way through.
There were trees, trees, trees! No path was
visible between them.
</p>
<p>For half a mile Mollie walked on blindly,
feeling sure that, at any minute, she would catch
a glimpse of their familiar hillside. A sense
of sinking warned her that luncheon time had
passed. High overhead she could see by the
sun that noon had passed.
</p>
<p>Several times she called aloud. But Naki had
warned her. This hill was entirely deserted. No
one ever walked or rode over it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; the little girl thought,
with a lump in her throat. &#8220;No one except myself
would be such a goose as to try to find her
way about up here, or be silly enough to go on
a ghost hunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She called again. &#8220;Hello! hello! I am lost!
Is anyone near?&#8221; There was no answer.
Once Mollie thought she heard a strange sound,
half-wild, half-human, and called more loudly.
This time there was no reply.
</p>
<p>After several hours of walking, Mollie found
her way out of the woods. As she came again
to an open hilltop she thought she could see the
smoke curling out of the chimney of their little,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
brown cabin, but far and near, there was no
familiar object. She had followed the wrong
trail, and was in an entirely different part of the
country. There was nothing to do but to return
to the woods.
</p>
<p>Wearily she walked back. &#8220;I am sure the
girls must be looking for me,&#8221; she said, trying
to revive her courage. &#8220;When I wasn&#8217;t home
in time for lunch Bab would know I was lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On and on, Mollie wandered. Finally, toward
dusk, she found herself again in the heart of
the forest where she had lost her way in the
morning. She was so tired, there was nothing
to do but to sit down and rest, but she had not
given up. Of course, she would find her way out
of this labyrinth of trees somehow. However,
just for the time, she must wait.
</p>
<p>Mollie sank down on a pile of leaves that had
been blown in a heap under the shelter of a great
cedar tree. It was growing cold, and the September
day was closing. All morning and afternoon
the little girl had wandered alone in the
woods. How many miles she had traveled she
did not know.
</p>
<p>The child shivered, as she dropped on the
ground. Tired as she was, she had plenty of
courage left. Not a tear had been shed in these
miles of weary tramping; indeed she had often
laughed at her own mistakes, though the laughter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
had sometimes been close to tears; but Mollie
knew that she must not lose her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose, I do have to stay in the woods all
night?&#8221; she reflected. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t kill me. I
have wanted to have adventures in a forest; here
is my opportunity. I wish, though, I knew how
to make a fire; I&#8217;m so cold and hungry; but I
haven&#8217;t a sign of a match, so there is no use of
thinking about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Mollie could but have kept awake a little
longer! No sooner had she dropped on the soft
leaves than fatigue overcame her, and she was
fast asleep.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a figure came out of the underbrush&mdash;a
strange young figure all brown and
scarlet. It moved so softly that scarcely a leaf
trembled. For a minute it paused and gazed
down on the sleeping child. The little girl
stirred in her sleep. With a bound the wood
sprite vanished. It need not have hurried; Mollie
was too utterly weary to awaken soon.
</p>
<p>What had happened at the log cabin, meantime?
</p>
<p>All morning Ruth, Bab and Grace had been
practising under the instruction of Naki. Bab
was growing into a clever shot, and Ruth was
playing her a close second, when the luncheon
gong sounded. The girls had given no further
thought to Mollie, supposing she had grown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
tired of her walk, and was at home with Miss
Sallie. The latter naturally was not worried, as
she thought Mollie was with Naki and the others.
</p>
<p>When the girls filed into the living room for
their lunch Bab asked carelessly: &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mollie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mollie?&#8221; repeated Miss Sallie.
&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t she been shooting with you? Perhaps
she is somewhere near. Here is Ceally; I will
ask her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment Ceally entered with a great
bowl of vegetable soup that looked most inviting
to the hungry girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Miss Mollie all morning,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;Not since she started for a walk
up that hill over &#8216;yond&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara, Grace and Ruth stared at each other
with white, frightened faces. They remembered
Mollie had gone off for a walk early that
morning; but she had promised not to go far up
the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Naki, at once,&#8221; said Miss Stuart hurriedly.
&#8220;He will probably know where Mollie
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, auntie.&#8221; Ruth shook her head. &#8220;Naki
doesn&#8217;t know. He has been teaching us to shoot
all the forenoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab jumped up from the table. &#8220;Please, Miss
Sallie,&#8221; she cried hastily, &#8220;may Naki and I go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
out to look for Mollie? I am afraid she is lost
on the hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Bab,&#8221; quietly said Miss Sallie, in
the voice the girls recognized as final. &#8220;You
and the other girls must each eat a plate of this
soup. You are not to start out to look for Mollie
when you are tired and hungry. Ceally, see
that Naki has some food at once, and bring the
coffee to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara was almost crying. &#8220;Oh, Miss Sallie,&#8221;
she pleaded, &#8220;I can&#8217;t eat. Don&#8217;t make me
wait. I must go at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat your soup, Barbara,&#8221; was Miss Sallie&#8217;s
reply.
</p>
<p>Poor Bab obediently choked it down, while
Ruth and Grace followed her example. Then
they each drank a cup of coffee.
</p>
<p>It was Miss Sallie who ate nothing. She was
more frightened than the girls; for the woods
were more terrible to her than to the young people.
Then, Mollie was the youngest of the party,
and Miss Stuart felt she was less able to look
after herself. Besides, Ceally had hinted
strange tales of the haunted mountain back of
them. At the time, Miss Sallie had refused to
listen; it had seemed utter nonsense, that tale of
a ghost which haunted a lost Indian trail. Now,
the idea came to Miss Stuart, that perhaps the
ghost on the mountain was some criminal, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
fugitive from justice, who made his home on the
deserted hill.
</p>
<p>It was Bab who led the way up to the top of
the ravine. But there she stopped and waited
for Naki and the girls to join her.
</p>
<p>Looking for lost people in the woods was an
old business with the guide. He did not take
the fact of disobedient Mollie&#8217;s disappearance
any too seriously. Once up the hill, he blew on
a great horn which he carried. Once, twice,
thrice! There was no response. He blew again,
then waited. Evidently the young lady was out
of earshot.
</p>
<p>Then Naki made a mistake. Instead of going
into the woods, where Mollie had pursued
her will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, he turned in the opposite
direction. It did not dawn on him that she had
been led astray by a forgotten Indian trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must keep close to me, young ladies,&#8221;
Naki insisted. &#8220;None of ye know your way
about up here. If we should separate, I should
soon be searching for the whole lot of ye, instead
of just one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All afternoon they searched and searched for
the lost one, yet all in vain.
</p>
<p>If Mollie shed no tears while she was lost,
Barbara shed plenty in the effort to find her.
Poor Grace and Ruth tried vainly to comfort
her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If only we hadn&#8217;t quarreled this morning
over that horrid Reginald Latham!&#8221; Bab
sobbed, running on ahead of the others. &#8220;I
told Mollie she was foolish to say she hated anyone
whom she did not know. Yet I do it all the
time myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do cheer up, Bab,&#8221; said Grace, choking
back her own tears. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t quarrel with
Mollie. I never saw two sisters who fussed so
little. I know we shall find her soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing up here can harm your sister,
Miss,&#8221; Naki explained to frightened Bab.
&#8220;The country around here is perfectly peaceful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At dusk Naki and his searching party returned
alone to the top of the ravine from whence they
had started. Looking down, they could see their
log cabin, where Miss Sallie and Ceally stood at
the open door. There was no sign of Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is harder work than I expected to find the
young lady,&#8221; Naki apologized to Ruth. &#8220;I am
sorry, but you had better go back to your aunt.
I must go down to the farm for help. It will
take a number of people to make a thorough
search of this place to-night. The underbrush
is so thick that it is hard work traveling about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t go home without Mollie!&#8221;
sobbed Bab. &#8220;I am not a bit afraid to stay up
here alone. Leave me, Ruth, you and Grace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
I&#8217;ll just sit at the top of this ravine and call and
call! Then, if Mollie comes anywhere near me,
she will hear. You and Grace go and have supper
with Miss Sallie. You can bring me something
to eat afterwards, if you like.&#8221; Barbara
smiled feebly.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Grace both turned on her indignantly.
It was a relief to pretend to be offended.
&#8220;Oh, yes, Bab, we are both delighted
to go down and comfortably eat our supper! It
is so pleasant to think of your sitting up here
alone, like a stone image, and poor little Mollie
lost&mdash;goodness knows where!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth kissed Bab for comfort. Then she
turned to Grace. &#8220;Grace,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;will
you be a perfect dear? I know Naki is right; he
must get some one to help him search for Mollie,
and one of us must go to Aunt Sallie, who is
terribly worried. See! she has already seen us,
and is waving her hand. But if you will go tell
her what has happened, I shall stay up here with
Bab, and Ceally can bring us some dinner. You
can come back afterwards. By that time Naki
will have returned with assistance and we can go
on with our search again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to leave you,&#8221; Grace protested, &#8220;but
I will go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for me,&#8221; Naki cautioned. Both girls
nodded. They were too tired to speak.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>END OF THE SEARCH</h3>
</div>

<p>When Grace and Naki had finally disappeared
Bab put her head down on
Ruth&#8217;s shoulder and cried bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so frightened!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;If only
I were lost instead of my little sister! Mother
always trusts me to look after Mollie. I ought
not to have let her go off alone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth wisely allowed Bab to have her cry out,
before she said: &#8220;Bab, dear, remember father
said he relied on us to keep cool heads and
strong hearts in any case of emergency. Now
let&#8217;s gather ourselves together. Let&#8217;s say over
and over again: &#8216;We will find Mollie! We will
find Mollie!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab braced up at once and repeated quietly,
&#8220;Certainly we will find her, Ruth dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both girls were looking toward the woods.
It was not yet night, but the dusk was
falling quickly. Suddenly, off through the
trees, the two girls distinctly saw a light that
shone on a level with their eyes. Once,
twice, then again, it sparkled through the underbrush.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Bab breathed faintly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Ruth shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she
answered, under her breath.
</p>
<p>The light advanced toward them; then it drew
back again, never ceasing to sparkle. It seemed
to be beckoning to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ruth,&#8221; cried Barbara, &#8220;could it be a
signal from Mollie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could it, Barbara, dear?&#8221; Ruth replied.
</p>
<p>Both girls waited a little longer. The light
came again. It seemed almost to call to them.
Barbara started to her feet impatiently. &#8220;I
must go and see what it is,&#8221; she declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Bab!&#8221; pleaded Ruth. It
was second nature with Ruth to be ready for
emergencies. Rapidly she tore from a pad in her
leather knapsack a sheet of paper and wrote
on it: &#8220;Bab and I are going into the woods at
the left. Follow the trail of the paper I shall
drop as we walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Like a flash she pulled off her white petticoat,
and tied it to a bush near the place where she
and Bab had been sitting. The skirt fluttered
and swung in the breeze. Beneath it, under a
small stone, Ruth placed her note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Bab!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara bounded ahead; Ruth closely followed,
leaving behind her a trail of white paper
which she tore into bits as she ran.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>The light ahead of the two girls beckoned
them deeper and deeper into the forests. They
must have followed it for more than a mile.
Ruth&#8217;s paper was giving out. Suddenly the
light dipped to the ground and was gone!
</p>
<p>At the same moment, Ruth and Barbara
heard a sizzling crackling noise. A tongue of
flame darted up between two distant trees, and
a warm glow like that of a camp fire lit up the
shadows of the forest.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Bab rushed to the spot. In the center
of a small open space some one had lighted
a fire. Sitting on a bank of autumn leaves,
slowly rubbing her eyes was a girl. A scarlet
coat caught Bab&#8217;s eyes; then a tangle of yellow
curls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my Mollie!&#8221; she cried, springing toward
her and gathering her in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bab,&#8221; asked Mollie sleepily, &#8220;when
did you and Ruth find me? I must have been
dreaming. I did not hear you make the fire.
How did you happen to light a fire before you
awakened me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls stared at Mollie. &#8220;Build a fire?&#8221;
they queried in amazement. &#8220;Surely, Mollie,
you made the fire yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie shook her head. &#8220;How could I possibly
light a fire?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a
match.&#8221; Then she smiled faintly. &#8220;I am not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
enough of an &#8216;early settler&#8217; to know how to make
a light by striking two flints together. But
please take me home.&#8221; The little girl was too
tired to care about anything beyond the blessed
fact that she had been found.
</p>
<p>It was Bab and Ruth who were overcome with
the mystery of the dancing light that led them
through the forest straight to Mollie. And
who could have started the fire, that now roared
and blazed, lighting the woods with its many
tongues of flame. What did it all mean? The
mystery of it all gave them long, creepy thrills.
</p>
<p>Barbara helped Mollie to her feet. The child
was so stiff she could hardly move, but as she
arose something red dropped to the ground.
Ruth picked it up. &#8220;Why, it is Grace&#8217;s
sweater!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I am so glad you
found it, Mollie, before you went for your walk.
What a blessed thing you had it to keep you
warm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace&#8217;s sweater! What are you talking
about, Ruth? I didn&#8217;t have it with me. I was
nearly frozen. You or Bab must have brought
it with you. I found it over my shoulders when
I awoke,&#8221; protested Mollie.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Bab said nothing. There was nothing
to be said. It was all a puzzle! Where
was the clue to the mystery?
</p>
<p>The two girls were leading poor, tired Mollie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
through the thick tangle of shrubs, along which
Ruth&#8217;s bits of torn paper gleamed white and
cheerful pointing their pathway home. Even
Mollie smiled on seeing them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If only I had remembered to play &#8216;Hop-o-my-thumb,&#8217;
Ruth, dear,&#8221; Mollie whispered, &#8220;I
needn&#8217;t have created all this trouble. Do you
think Miss Sallie will ever forgive me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed she will,&#8221; Ruth assured her. &#8220;She
will be so happy to see you again, you poor,
tired Mollie, she&#8217;ll forget to scold!&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the girls could hear the noise of
voices and the beating of bushes. &#8220;Here we
are!&#8221; Ruth called out cheerfully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry. We have found Mollie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki burst through the opening. Ceally and
Grace were with him and two strange men from
the farm below them on the hill.
</p>
<p>Naki picked up Mollie in his arms as though
she had been a baby, and the party trudged on
to their little log cabin.
</p>
<p>At the top of the fateful ravine they found
Miss Sallie. She could bear the suspense of
waiting no longer and had climbed up alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Home for sure!&#8221; proclaimed Naki briefly, as
he deposited Mollie, still wrapped in Grace&#8217;s
red sweater, on the couch before the fire in their
cosy living room.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SPIRIT OF THE FOREST</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It is perfectly incredible!&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Sallie.
</p>
<p>She and Bab were discussing Mollie&#8217;s
adventure the next morning at breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The more I try to reason out the whole
thing, the more in the dark I am,&#8221; Bab answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you talked with Mollie?&#8221; Miss Sallie
inquired.
</p>
<p>Bab nodded, and replied thoughtfully: &#8220;The
truth of the matter is, Mollie knows less on the
subject than the rest of us. All that she can
tell is that she was sitting quietly at the bottom
of the ravine, when suddenly a shower of leaves
fell over her head, and she heard the noise of
feet running along the bank above her. Determined
to discover what had startled her, Mollie
climbed up the ravine and kept on with her
pursuit until she was completely lost. She must
have wandered around all day. Finally she was
so tired she sat down to rest. When she awoke
Ruth and I had found her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Grace&#8217;s sweater! Where did it come
from?&#8221; asked Miss Sallie weakly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Ceally who entered the room at this moment,
with her arms full of logs for the fire, caught the
end of the conversation. She looked about her
cautiously. Naki, her husband, was some distance
away, cutting down the underbrush which
was growing too high near their cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss,&#8221; whispered Ceally cautiously, &#8220;they
do say there is a ghost up on that mountain. It
must have been a ghost that led Miss Mollie on
that lost trail. Once you strike that trail, there
ain&#8217;t no way of finding your way back again,
unless you follow some such clue as Miss Ruth&#8217;s
bits of paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghosts! Utter nonsense, Ceally!&#8221; scolded
Miss Sallie. But under her breath she confessed
to herself: &#8220;If anything in this world could
bring me to believe in ghosts it would be this
mysterious occurrence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth flew in at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;here is a man
on horseback, with a note from Mr. Latham.
He wants us to come down and spend the afternoon
with him. He says he will send for us in
a carriage that can come almost all the way up
the hill, so we need only walk a little way. Do
let&#8217;s go! Want to, Bab?&#8221; Ruth finished.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie looked dubious. &#8220;It is a good deal
of a task, child, to go down this hill, except when
we mean to stay down,&#8221; she protested.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Aunt Sallie!&#8221; Ruth begged. &#8220;You
know Naki goes down the hill every day, on
some errand or other. I have been to Lenox
twice myself and to Pittsfield once. I won&#8217;t
give you and Bab these letters, unless you promise
to accept. One is for Bab, from her mother;
the other is for you, from father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart was reading Mr. Latham&#8217;s note.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister-in-law is with me,&#8221; it read. &#8220;She
joins her entreaties to Reginald&#8217;s and mine to
beg our hillside fairies to come down to the earth
and have afternoon tea with us. We are to
have no other guests, except a few young people
whom I am sure your girls will like to meet.
Later on, when you condescend to spend a few
weeks in Lenox, it may be a pleasure for you to
know them. Certainly it will be a pleasure for
them to know you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man is waiting outside for your answer,&#8221;
proclaimed Ruth, dancing first on one
foot and then on the other. &#8220;Here are pen and
paper. Do write and let me take the note out
to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart allowed herself to be persuaded
into accepting Mr. Latham&#8217;s invitation. Life
on the hill was growing a bit dull for Miss Sallie.
She dreaded the long trip, but Mr. Latham&#8217;s
place lay between their hill and the town
of Lenox.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Mollie came into the room as Ruth ran out to
deliver the note of acceptance. &#8220;Who is out
there?&#8221; she inquired languidly. The little girl
was not yet rested from her experience of the
day before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are invited to the Latham place this
afternoon, Molliekins!&#8221; Bab explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going, Miss Sallie?&#8221; Mollie asked.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart nodded. &#8220;Yes, I think so, child,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;It is a dreadfully long journey,
but Ruth is determined to go, and I am as wax
in her hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie Stuart, you are no such thing!&#8221;
Ruth laughed, as she returned to the little group.
&#8220;I am the most obedient niece in the world.
You know you liked Mr. Latham. And he has
a marvelous place, with a wonderful fish pond on
it. From his veranda he says you can see over
into four states, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts
and Vermont!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, girls, we will start promptly after an
early lunch,&#8221; Miss Stuart remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie,&#8221; interrupted Mollie gently, &#8220;remember
I am in the guard house for the next
twenty-four hours. I broke all camp regulations
by being lost yesterday. So I can&#8217;t go
with the party to Mr. Latham&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Mollie!&#8221; said Miss Stuart kindly.
&#8220;I was only joking when I threatened to establish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
military discipline in my camp. Besides,
if you were disobedient, you were well enough
punished for it. Don&#8217;t you wish to come with
us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie shook her head. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind,
Miss Sallie, I would rather not,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I am a little tired and I would rather stay
quietly up here. You can count on my promise
this time. I won&#8217;t go more than a yard from
the cabin. Naki and Ceally will both be here to
look after me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will stay with Mollie,&#8221; spoke up Bab. &#8220;I
prefer not to leave her alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie protested energetically. &#8220;Bab, you
must not stay behind with me. If you insist on
doing it, I shall go with you, no matter how tired
I feel. You know you are the one original lady
rescuer of an airship yet on record! I was only
the legs of the rescue, as I ran after Naki and
Ceally. You were the brains of the whole business.
Besides, you know you are simply dying
to see Reginald Latham&#8217;s airship models, as well
as their beautiful house and grounds. Make her
go, Miss Sallie!&#8221; Mollie ended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no reason, Bab, why you shouldn&#8217;t accompany
us.&#8221; Miss Sallie declared. &#8220;Naki
and Ceally will look after Mollie, and an afternoon&#8217;s
rest will be much better for the child
than a long, fatiguing excursion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>Mollie walked to the edge of the hill to see Miss
Sallie and her charges start off on their excursion
to Mr. Latham&#8217;s. Then she thankfully
crept home to the little cabin and stretched herself
out on her cot, with the eider down comfort
drawn up to her head. The child, who was not
so vigorous as Bab, was worn out from her fright
and exposure. An hour later she awakened,
feeling bright and rested as though she had never
been lost in a strange woods.
</p>
<p>It was a lovely, bright afternoon. Mollie
could hear the leaves rustling outside, as the
wind stirred them and they fluttered to the
ground. The little girl had read that a swan
sings a wonderful song just as he is about to die.
She walked out on the porch with an odd fancy
in her head. She stopped and listened again to
the sound the autumn leaves made, as they
swirled from the trees to the earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; Mollie smiled to herself, &#8220;that
the autumn leaves sing their swan song, too.&#8221;
She pointed to a beautiful, golden maple leaf,
that was fluttering in the air. &#8220;See, there is a
leaf! It is singing its good-bye song to the tree,
which has borne it all summer! The little leaf
is traveling to an unknown land down under the
ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie laughed at her own idea. It was difficult
for her to keep her eyes turned away from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
her ravine. She glanced up the hill. Surely
she saw a figure moving there. It was a slight
young creature, no larger than Mollie herself.
Was it a boy or girl? It was impossible
to tell, though the figure was drawing toward
her.
</p>
<p>The little girl watched with fascinated eyes.
Down the ravine crept a thin, brown body. Now
it looked this way, then that. Hardly touching
the earth, it flew from one high rock to the other.
Then it dipped into the hollow between the two
hills and was gone.
</p>
<p>This time Mollie did not stir from her veranda,
but through her brain flashed the thought&mdash;the
ghost at last!
</p>
<p>In another moment she saw a black head rise
up on a level with her eyes. Mollie gave a gasp
of surprise, then was silent. A thin, brown
creature moved softly toward her on velvet feet.
Mollie hardly breathed. Never in her life had
she beheld so odd, so exquisite a figure.
</p>
<p>A girl about her own age stood before her.
Her hair hung over her shoulders, black and
straight. Her cheeks were a deep carmine.
Her complexion was too dark to be olive, yet it
was neither brown nor red. She was dressed
in a thin, soft garment that fitted her closely
from her bare neck to her ankles. Around her
waist she had knotted a crimson scarf. On her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
head she wore a fantastic wreath of scarlet autumn
leaves.
</p>
<p>The newcomer stared at Mollie. Once, like a
startled fawn, she turned to flee. But Mollie was
too wise to speak or to move. Reassured, the
quaint visitor drew nearer.
</p>
<p>Mollie smiled at her quietly. &#8220;Are you
afraid of me?&#8221; she asked gently. &#8220;Come here,
I shall not hurt you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly the stranger&#8217;s dark, sad little face
burst into a smile. &#8220;I am not afraid,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;I am never afraid. But is it well with
you?&#8221; She spoke English, but with a strange
guttural note Mollie had never heard before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should it not be well with me?&#8221; asked
Mollie in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; the wood sprite answered, &#8220;you
were lost yesterday in the hills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; Mollie demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I know?&#8221; The girl lifted her head
proudly. &#8220;I know all things that take place in
the woods,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The woods are my
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie looked thoughtful; then she spoke in a
firm voice: &#8220;You know for other reasons, as
well. You know I was lost because you led me
away yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s brown face crimsoned, her eyes
flashed. Then she lifted her head proudly. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
led you nowhere!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;You would
follow me. No one can run as I do, or capture
me when they hunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Mollie asked her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am nobody,&#8221; the young girl replied. It
seemed to Mollie she spoke sadly. But she
dropped down on the steps of the porch and
waited until Mollie joined her there.
</p>
<p>Mollie put out her own soft, white hand and
took the other girl&#8217;s brown fingers in her own.
The hands were slender and long, with hard
muscles trained to the work of the woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mollie gently, &#8220;if I <i>would</i> follow
you, perhaps my getting lost was my own
fault. But was it quite fair of you to come each
morning to our windows, and then fly away
again before anyone could see you?&#8221; Mollie was
only guessing at this; but it was easy to see her
guess had struck home.
</p>
<p>Her visitor turned a deeper crimson and
dropped her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you meant no harm by your morning
calls,&#8221; continued Mollie smilingly. &#8220;But, if
you didn&#8217;t lead me away into the woods, there is
one thing I feel very sure of; you did show my
friends how to find me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, hush!&#8221; cried the wood nymph, rising
to her feet and looking around in terror, her
slender body poised for flight. &#8220;Promise me,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
she pleaded, &#8220;that you will not tell you have
seen me, nor that I ever came here to you.&#8221; The
girl dropped on her knees at Mollie&#8217;s feet. &#8220;I
am an Indian girl,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I live on
Lost Man&#8217;s Mountain, but I know no one, and
no one knows me. Only Naki your guide has
seen me. But he, too, has Indian blood. He
will not betray me. My name is Eunice. I have
no other name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you cannot live alone,&#8221; Mollie protested.
</p>
<p>The Indian girl shook her head without answering.
&#8220;If I tell you,&#8221; she implored, &#8220;will
you promise me by the stars never to betray
me? Promise, promise, or I shall disappear and
you will see me never again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Mollie answered thoughtlessly, &#8220;I
promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A swift change swept over the Indian girl&#8217;s
face. She leaned confidingly toward Mollie,
who realized for the first time what her promise
meant. She was already dying to tell Bab and
the other girls of her afternoon&#8217;s experience,
but she vowed to herself to keep the child&#8217;s
secret.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not live alone,&#8221; Eunice declared. &#8220;I
have a grandmother, who is an old, old Indian
woman. Our hut is far back in the hills. All
day I have watched and waited by your cabin,
until the others went away. I wanted to see that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
all was right with you. I trust you with my
secret. Now, I must be far away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t you come again, Eunice?&#8221; begged
Mollie. &#8220;Why not come and see all of us? We
are only other girls like you. My sister and her
friends have only gone away for a visit to the
Lathams&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice started and shook her black hair.
&#8220;Latham! You must not speak the name to
me!&#8221; she cried fiercely. &#8220;My grandmother says
it is an evil name, and will work harm to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie laughed at her. &#8220;The name of Latham
is nothing to you, Eunice,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;But won&#8217;t you let me thank you for leading
my sister to me? You must have been the will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
with the dark lantern. You must
have made the fire, and&mdash;and&mdash;you must even
have put Grace&#8217;s sweater over my shoulders as
I lay asleep. You are my ghost!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian girl drew herself up proudly, but
her dark face turned curiously white. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
she muttered, &#8220;I took the red cloak away. My
grandmother says that I stole it, and Indians of
royal blood do not steal. I am no ghost, I am a
princess!&#8221; Eunice looked at Mollie with
haughty grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know I was stealing,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;I saw the soft, red thing. I did not think. I
love the scarlet colors in the world.&#8221; She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
touched the crimson leaves in her hair. &#8220;When
I found that I had stolen I meant to bring the
cloak back. Then I saw you asleep in the
woods. You looked so cold and white that I put
the cloak over your shoulders to keep you warm.
Now you have your own again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Eunice,&#8221; Mollie inquired, more and
more puzzled by the girl&#8217;s appearance and conversation,
&#8220;are you a pure-blooded Indian? You
do not look like one. Your eyes are as big and
brown as my sister Bab&#8217;s, only a little darker.
And your features are so fine and pretty. Then
you speak such good English and your name is
Eunice. Have you ever been to school?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;A long time a
woman stayed in the tent with my grandmother
and me. She taught me to speak and to read
books. She comes again each winter with the
snows. My teacher is part Indian and part
white. My grandmother says that an Indian
princess must know, these days, all that the
white race knows, and she must have the knowledge
of her own people as well. But I go now.
You will not tell you have seen me. Then, some
day when you are alone, I may return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a second, Eunice?&#8221; begged Mollie and
disappeared inside their cabin. She came out
with a lovely red silk scarf in her hand. &#8220;Take
this, Eunice, it is for you!&#8221; she explained.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;An Indian princess
does not accept gifts,&#8221; she demurred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; laughed Mollie, throwing her gift over
Eunice&#8217;s brown shoulder, &#8220;you are a proud little
goose! I am sure it is a small enough gift.
I want to thank you for the service you did for
me in the woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ceally was stirring about in the kitchen. Like
a flash the Indian girl was gone. Mollie sat on
the veranda steps rubbing her eyes. Had her
visitor been a real girl, or was Mollie bewitched
by a brown elf?

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A KNOCK AT THE DOOR</h3>
</div>

<p>The moon had come up over the tree-tops
before Miss Sallie, with Ruth, Bab and
Grace returned from their visit to Mr.
Winthrop Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly have missed it, this time,
Miss Mollie!&#8221; cried Bab, running into the room
where Mollie sat reading. &#8220;We have had the
most wonderful time, and met the most charming
people. I never saw anything so beautiful
as the village of Lenox. We had a splendid
view of it from the tower in Mr. Latham&#8217;s house.
Lenox is called a village of seventy hills, but I
am sure we counted more than seventy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am truly sorry you were not with us, Mollie,&#8221;
declared Miss Sallie, coming into the house
with the other two girls. &#8220;But you will have
plenty of opportunity for seeing what we did
later on. It will not be long now, before we
shall go down in the town to stay. Did you have
a nice, quiet time by yourself?&#8221; Mollie felt embarrassed.
She had hardly been alone. But the
other girls did not give her an opportunity to
answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, we have the finest plan!&#8221; Ruth broke
in. &#8220;We are going to have a coon hunt up on
the hill. Mr. Latham says it is just the thing to
do on these early autumn nights. All the people
we met at his house this afternoon are to come
up to supper with us to-morrow evening. Afterwards,
we are to start out after Br&#8217;er Possum
and Br&#8217;er Coon. Won&#8217;t it be a jolly lark?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t approve of it, Ruth,&#8221; said Miss Sallie.
&#8220;I am sure young girls never before took
part in such an excursion. I shouldn&#8217;t allow it,
except that Mr. Latham and his sister both assured
me it was done by the best people in Lenox.
Then the English ambassador&#8217;s daughters are to
join you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth looked solemnly at Bab and Grace. The
girls were secretly amused at Miss Sallie&#8217;s social
ambitions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; Ruth explained, &#8220;we did meet two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
such nice English girls this afternoon&mdash;Gwendolin
and Dorothy Morton&mdash;and an awfully
funny, little man, a secretary at the German
embassy. They say that ambassadors are as
common in Lenox, in the season, as millionaires!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you like Reginald Latham to-day, Bab?&#8221;
Mollie inquired, as the two sisters walked into
their bedroom together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; admitted Bab. &#8220;I liked him as
usual. He is a peaceable kind of man, but rather
queer. He is too learned for me. His mother
seems terribly vain of him. She does nothing
but talk about his inventive skill. I believe she
encourages the airship business just to get on
the good side of his uncle. Mr. Winthrop Latham
is simply crazy on the subject and does not
seem to care about anything else. And he must
have a tremendous lot of money. But Mrs.
Latham, the German sister-in-law, as good as
told Aunt Sallie she and her son were dreadfully
poor. They had always been obliged to live on
the income Mr. Winthrop Latham allowed them,
since her husband lost his money. But I
shouldn&#8217;t think she and her son need worry;
Reginald assured me that he was his uncle&#8217;s only
heir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bab,&#8221; Grace asked, joining the two sisters,
&#8220;why did you spend so much time out in that shed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
looking at airship models? You know you did
not understand them in the least; but our host
and his blessed nephew were certainly pleased
at your interest. Mrs. Latham showed Aunt
Sallie and Ruth and me over the house. They
have an art gallery and rooms full of curios, just
like a museum. The house is a perfect palace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an older Mr. Latham once!&#8221;
Ruth announced, sticking her head in from the
door of her bedroom to join in the conversation.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think he was a credit to the family.
They are silent about him. I asked one of the
girls we met this afternoon if Mr. Winthrop
Latham and his nephew were all of the Latham
family. Just as she started to tell me, Reginald
Latham came up to us, and she stopped talking
in a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ruth Stuart, I believe I was talking,&#8221;
interrupted Grace severely. &#8220;Kindly allow me
the floor! Mollie is most certainly not interested
in the Latham family history. Who is? Nor
does she care a fig for Mr. Reginald Latham
and his toy balloons. But, Mollie, I was endeavoring
to tell you about the wonderful curios
they have in their house. The late lamented
brother, we were informed, has left behind him
one of the most famous collection of Indian relics
in the world. If I am obliged to mention the
stupid subject of family history, I must say that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
the Lathams are an old family up in this part
of the country. They do not belong to the
&#8216;newly rich.&#8217; The queer elder brother devoted
his life to the study of the history of the Indians
in this part of the world, and has written a book
about them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace, have you finished making your
speech?&#8221; inquired Ruth, with mock politeness.
&#8220;Poor Mollie must be bored stiff with all this
useless information. How did you spend the
afternoon, dear? We have talked so much
about coon hunts and Indian relics and the Lathams
that you have had no chance to answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I took a nap!&#8221; responded Mollie,
vaguely, and led the way into supper.
</p>
<p>Late that evening, as the girls sat by the fire,
they heard a sudden knocking at their cabin
door. Miss Sallie, who was in bed, bounded out
again. For the first time since their arrival in
the woods the camping party was alone. Naki
had been obliged to go down the hill on an errand.
No one had dreamed of any possible danger
in his absence.
</p>
<p>The knocking continued. &#8220;Open! Open!&#8221;
cried the voices of two men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who on earth can they be?&#8221; Grace asked of
the circle of girls. No one answered. Ceally
came hurriedly in from the kitchen. Miss Sallie
stood at her door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>The knocks were repeated in quick succession.
</p>
<p>Ceally had taken the precaution, earlier in
the evening, to close and bolt all the doors and
windows except one. The shutters of this were
open on the outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-sh!&#8221; whispered Bab, creeping on tiptoes
to the window. Before their front door, she
could dimly outline the figures of two men, who
were evidently arguing and protesting about
something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Open! Open!&#8221; cried the voices again. &#8220;We
are friends, and will do you no harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then go away at once!&#8221; Miss Sallie commanded.
</p>
<p>There was a muffled sound outside the door.
Could it be laughter? Then a voice called more
roughly. &#8220;How long must we wait?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth and Bab looked at each other blankly.
Miss Stuart had gone back into her own room.
&#8220;What on earth shall we do? Shall we open
the door?&#8221; Ruth inquired.
</p>
<p>Mollie and Grace both shook their heads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; whispered Barbara resourcefully,
&#8220;your rifle is behind that door, and Naki&#8217;s big
shotgun is next to it. Of course, we don&#8217;t know
how to shoot either one of the guns very well at
present, but, if you will hold your rifle pointed
toward the door, I shall try to shoulder this
heavy shotgun. Oh, I have a splendid idea!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it, child!&#8221; ordered Ruth. &#8220;I believe
the knocking on the door will keep up all
night, unless we open it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; inquired Grace, timidly, before
Bab could answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; responded the men on the outside.
</p>
<p>Barbara motioned silence. &#8220;Listen to me,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We have no way of knowing if
those men on the outside are friends, whatever
they may say. Here is my scheme! Remember
the story of the women in a town near
here, who once defended their fort against an
attack by the Indians, when the men were all
away at work in the cornfields? The women
dressed up in their husbands&#8217; clothes and frightened
the Indians away. Ruth, let&#8217;s disguise
ourselves as men and then let Ceally open the
door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bab, you and Ruth are both crazy!&#8221; protested
Mollie, half-laughing, and half-frightened.
</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! The blows on the door were
tremendous. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t let us in, you&#8217;ll be
sorry!&#8221; called one of the men.
</p>
<p>Bab had already found an old hat of Naki&#8217;s
conveniently near. Ceally, who was giggling
nervously, produced a hunting jacket of her husband&#8217;s,
which had seen much service. It was
not clean, but Bab slipped into it, determined
to see her plan through.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>Nor was Barbara the only hero. While she
was making her extraordinary costume, Ruth
had torn down a squirrel skin, which some previous
hunter had tacked on their cabin wall and
twisted it around her head so that the tail
hung down to one side. Then she slipped
on her own leather coat, which she gave a more
dilapidated appearance, by wearing it wrong
side out.
</p>
<p>Both girls got behind chairs to hide their
skirts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Ruth!&#8221; giggled Bab, in spite
of her excitement. &#8220;You look like Daniel
Boone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During their preparation not a word was
heard from Miss Sallie, who was closeted in her
own room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ceally, open the door!&#8221; cried Ruth, raising
her rifle and leveling it in front of her.
</p>
<p>Bab put her elbow on the back of her chair to
steady her shotgun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; cried Miss Stuart, unexpectedly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t dare to open that door!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she spoke too late. Ceally had already
drawn the heavy bolt back and the door swung
aside.
</p>
<p>There rushed into the room two men&mdash;or to be
strictly truthful, two boys.
</p>
<p>They looked first at Mollie and Grace, then at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Ruth and Bab. Without a word they dropped
into two chairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; they shouted. &#8220;Did you ever
see anything in the world so funny? Ralph,
look at Ruth!&#8221; cried Hugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph Ewing and Hugh Post, where did you
come from?&#8221; demanded four girls&#8217; voices together.
&#8220;We took you for highwaymen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab set down her shotgun and Ruth her rifle.
Both girls began pulling off their masculine disguises.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take off those terrifying garments,
Bab!&#8221; cried Ralph Ewing. &#8220;You, Ruth, should
have your picture taken in that hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time, Miss Stuart, fully dressed, with
her pompadour neatly arranged appeared at the
door. Highwaymen or no highwaymen, Miss
Sallie had no intention of appearing before
strange men without being properly dressed.
Now she was mistress of herself and of the situation.
</p>
<p>Both Huge Post and Ralph Ewing stopped
laughing when they saw Miss Sallie&#8217;s face. She
did not appear overpleased to see her two young
friends, whose doings were fully described in
the preceding volume. &#8220;The Automobile Girls
at Newport.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; she asked politely,
but without enthusiasm. &#8220;And why did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
you knock on our door at this time of the evening,
without informing us who you were?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; continued Miss Sallie severely,
&#8220;what are you and Barbara doing in those
clothes? Take them off at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; responded Bab meekly, but
with a twinkle in her eye, &#8220;we dressed up as men
to frighten the highwaymen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are enough to frighten them, I am
sure,&#8221; retorted Miss Stuart scornfully.
</p>
<p>Here, Ralph Ewing spoke in his most charming
manner: &#8220;Miss Sallie, we do owe you an
apology and we make it with all our hearts. We
had no intention of playing any pranks when we
came up the hill to see you. Several days ago
we were informed that &#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217;
were camping in the Berkshires. Well, Hugh
and I are on our way to Boston to join Mrs.
Post, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, do let me do my share of the apologizing,&#8221;
interrupted Hugh. &#8220;See here, Miss
Sallie, this nonsense to-night is all my fault.
Ralph was dead against my pounding at the door
and refusing to give our names; but I thought
it would be fun to stir the girls up. I knew two
such valiant girls as Ruth and Barbara would
not be really frightened, even if we had been a
whole band of outlaws. It was a stupid practical
joke and I am ashamed of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But how did you find us, Hugh?&#8221; put in
Ruth, who was embarrassed by her aunt&#8217;s lack
of cordiality to their old Newport friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Aunt Sallie, say you&#8217;ll forgive us!&#8221;
Hugh pleaded. &#8220;See how many miles we have
traveled to see you. We would have been here
in the broad daylight, only one of the tires in
my machine would get a puncture. The man at
the garage told us which hill to climb to find you.
We met your guide coming down the hill, and
he gave us further instructions. So here we
are! Aren&#8217;t you just a little glad to see us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I am,&#8221; laughed Aunt Sallie, amiably.
&#8220;But there is one thing certain: you can&#8217;t
get down our hill again to-night, and we have no
place to offer you to sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what is preying on my hospitable
aunt&#8217;s mind all this time?&#8221; cried Ruth, throwing
her arms about Miss Sallie. &#8220;I thought she
wasn&#8217;t her usual charming self. Of course the
boys shan&#8217;t go down the hill again to-night. I
don&#8217;t know where they will sleep, either; but
Bab will bring her fertile brain to bear upon the
situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Stuart!&#8221; Ralph spoke in relieved
tones. &#8220;Is this why you are not pleased to see
us? We expect to go down the hill a little later.
On our way up we stopped at a farm house, and
the people promised to take us in for the night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
We&#8217;ll come back early in the morning, since
Hugh and I must be off again by afternoon.
Mrs. Post is waiting for us in Boston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, must you go so soon, boys?&#8221; pleaded
Ruth. &#8220;We are planning the jolliest lark. We
are to have a coon hunt up on the hill with some
acquaintances we have just made in Lenox.
They are to have supper with us, and are to
bring up a guide and some coon dogs for our hunt
later on. And you simply must stay at the cabin
to-night. See, there is a lounge here in the living
room, and we have plenty of quilts and
steamer rugs. One of you can have the couch
and the other can sleep on the floor by the fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May we, Miss Sallie?&#8221; Hugh queried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like, boys,&#8221; declared Miss Stuart,
now completely restored to good humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s stay by all means!&#8221; urged Ralph.
&#8220;What should we expect to sleep on except the
floor or the ground? This is the most effete
camping party I ever saw,&#8221; he declared, looking
around their cosy little cabin. &#8220;You have
all the comforts of home, here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you and Ralph can stay for our
coon hunt, Hugh?&#8221; asked Bab.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for sure, Barbara,&#8221; Hugh asserted. &#8220;I
will fix things up with the mater for a day; but
we shall have to be off the next day without fail.
Now, I have an awful confession to make.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it Hugh?&#8221; Ruth demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph and I are starving!&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;We were so bent on getting up to your hut before
it was too late, we didn&#8217;t have time to get
any dinner. Could you, would you, just give
us each a hunk of bread to stay our appetites?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor souls!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;Come on
out in the kitchen with me, Mollie. Let Bab and
Grace do the entertaining. We&#8217;ll fix you some
eggs and bacon in no time, the best you ever
tasted. Our cook has gone to bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a feast for everybody,&#8221; proposed
Bab. &#8220;May we, Miss Sallie? I am dreadfully
hungry again. I haven&#8217;t had anything to eat
for at least two hours and a half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, turn in then, everybody,&#8221; Ruth called
cheerily. &#8220;Here, Bab, you undertake the Welsh
rarebit and get out the pickles and crackers.
Mollie, get Hugh to help you open these cans of
soup. Grace, you and Ralph, set the table and
talk to Aunt Sallie, while I fry my precious
bacon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of such an extraordinary combination
of things to eat. You will ruin your digestions,&#8221;
was Miss Sallie&#8217;s comment. But she
ate just as much as anyone else.
</p>
<p>At midnight the girls were at last in bed.
Hugh and Ralph, both wrapped in blankets, were
in blissful sleep before the camp fire. They had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
scorned to accept the offer of the couch, wishing
to enjoy camp life to the fullest extent. So
peace followed good cheer in the hut.

<p>chanted Ralph bowing low to Barbara,
as she joined him in the clearing in front
of their house before breakfast next
morning. &#8220;See, mademoiselle, what a fine
poem I have thought out for you! Behold in
me the poet of the Berkshires!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara laughed. &#8220;You are a second-hand
poet, I am afraid, Ralph. I happen to know
that those lines were written by William Cullen
Bryant. But come into breakfast and stop
your poetizing. We have a busy day ahead of
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ralph and Barbara found Ruth with a big
sheet of paper in her hand and her brow
wrinkled into a serious frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must decide at once what to have to eat
at our supper party to-night. Naki is in a hurry
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
to get off to the village, so as to be back in time
to help with the preparations. Listen, chilluns,
while I read you my menu,&#8221; commanded Ruth
solemnly. &#8220;I am going to have a regular, old-fashioned
supper party with everything on the
table at once. Naki and Ceally can&#8217;t serve so
many people in any other style. Besides, if we
have to eat supper at eight and start off on our
coon hunt at nine, there won&#8217;t be time for many
courses. So here goes: Roast chicken, &#8216;ole Virginy&#8217;
ham, sent by Mr. Robert Stuart for just
such a special occasion, roast pig and apple
sauce, chestnuts, sweet potatoes, jellies, pies,
doughnuts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cease, and give me breakfast ere I perish at
the thought of overeating,&#8221; remonstrated Hugh.
While Miss Sallie protested, as she sat down
to her breakfast, &#8220;My dear Ruth, are you planning
to feed an army, or to entertain a few
guests at supper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do to help with the preparations,
Miss Sallie?&#8221; queried Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just keep out of the way as much as possible,
child,&#8221; Miss Stuart answered.
</p>
<p>But this suggestion did not agree with Ruth&#8217;s
ideas. &#8220;At least, Aunt Sallie,&#8221; she expostulated,
&#8220;we may be allowed to decorate the hut
as we like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, child. Spend the day bringing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
the woods into the house, and to-morrow in
throwing the trash out again, if you like. Only
don&#8217;t interrupt Ceally and Naki.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At half-past seven everything was ready for
supper. As for the coon hunt, no one of &#8220;The
Automobile Girls&#8221; had the faintest conception
of what it would be like, and Miss Sallie was as
ignorant as the rest of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only an excuse for a midnight frolic
among the young people,&#8221; she thought, indulgently.
&#8220;I presume no mischief will come of
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A barking of dogs announced the approach of
the guests. Four lean hounds, brown and yellow,
baying and straining at their leashes, tore
up the hill. Already the keen mountain air
stirred them. Br&#8217;er Possum and Br&#8217;er Coon
were even now placidly eating their suppers.
The dogs longed to be at the night&#8217;s business.
</p>
<p>While the young people feasted inside the
cabin, the men who were to conduct the hunt prepared
the pine torches to light them on their
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel sure this is a proper expedition, Mr.
Latham?&#8221; asked Aunt Sallie nervously. She
was standing at the door, waiting to see the party
start off. &#8220;Hugh,&#8221; she called at the last minute,
&#8220;promise me to look after Ruth and
Grace. Don&#8217;t get separated from them, or I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
shall never forgive you. Ralph, I trust you to
take care of Mollie and Bab.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Reginald Latham was standing near Miss
Stuart and overheard her instructions to the two
boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Miss Stuart,&#8221; he quizzed in the
affected fashion that so angered Mollie, &#8220;can&#8217;t
you trust me to look after Miss Thurston? I
have a score to pay back to her for her rescue
of me in my airship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie put her arm in Ralph&#8217;s as they walked
out the door together. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind that Latham
man,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see why
Bab likes him. See, they are starting off together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The great horn blew; the dogs barked violently.
</p>
<p>Twenty people, each carrying a pine torch, lit
up the shadows of the quiet woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I count three,&#8221; said Mr. Latham to the
keepers, &#8220;you can let the dogs go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One! two! three! and the hounds were off,
their noses pointed along the ground, their tails
standing out straight behind them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is coon hunting a cruel sport, Ralph?&#8221; Mollie
inquired. &#8220;If it is, I would rather stay
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; this is my first experience,&#8221;
Ralph replied. &#8220;But hurry along, little girl!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! The dogs have a coon on the
run!&#8221; shouted some one in front. A poor old
coon had been driven from his comfortable hollow
tree, and was running for his life over the
hard ground, pursued by excited dogs. Close
behind followed the hunters with their horns.
And, tumbling over one another rushing pell-mell
after them, came the crowd of heedless
young people. The party separated. Two of
the dogs tracked another coon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I half hope Mr. Coon will win this race!&#8221;
panted Barbara, close behind Reginald Latham.
&#8220;Remember Uncle Remus says, &#8216;Br&#8217;er Coon,
he was wunner deze here natchul pacers.&#8217; Certainly
he has me outclassed as a runner. Do
wait for me, Mr. Latham!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham had run ahead of the rest
of the party, and was tearing down a steep hill
with no light except from his pine torch. The
moon had gone behind a cloud.
</p>
<p>Barbara, farther up the hill, could see the reflection
of a sheet of water. Into it the poor
little hunted coon jumped, swimming for dear
life to the opposite shore. The dogs hesitated
a minute, then went into the water after it. But
Reginald Latham was now going so rapidly he
could not stop himself.
</p>
<p>With a rush he was in the water, just as Bab&#8217;s
warning cry rang out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Help me! I am drowning!&#8221; he shouted. For
the minute he and Barbara were alone. The
rest of the party had followed the two dogs,
whose baying sounded some distance across
through the woods.
</p>
<p>Barbara was down the bank, and out in the
stream in a second. To her disgust she found
the water only up to her waist. They were at
the edge of a small pond, but Reginald Latham
clutched at Barbara, panic-stricken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Latham,&#8221; cried Bab in disgust,
&#8220;you are not drowning. This water is not three
feet deep. We have only to walk out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this instant, Ralph Ewing and Mollie came
rushing down the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth&#8217;s the matter, Bab?&#8221; asked
Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; said Bab loyally, &#8220;except that
Mr. Coon has led us into a nice mud bath. I
expect Mr. Latham and I had better return home.
I don&#8217;t believe I am a first-class hunter. My
sympathies are too much on the side of the
coon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help either of you?&#8221; asked Ralph Ewing
courteously. But when Bab said &#8220;no,&#8221; he
and Mollie were off through the woods again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good of you, Miss Thurston,&#8221; Reginald
Latham apologized, as he and Bab made
their way up the hill again, &#8220;to take part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
responsibility for our plunge into the pond on
yourself. I am an awful coward about the
water. I would take my share of the blame, except
that my uncle would be so angry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not afraid of your uncle, are
you?&#8221; Bab inquired impetuously. &#8220;You seem
grown up to me, and I don&#8217;t see why you should
be afraid. Mr. Latham is awfully nice anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t understand, Miss Thurston,&#8221;
declared Reginald Latham peevishly. &#8220;Everything
in the world depends on my keeping on the
good side of my uncle. My mother has talked
of nothing else to me since I was a child. You
see, uncle has all the money in the family now.
He doesn&#8217;t have to leave me a red cent unless
he chooses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I would rather be independent than
rich,&#8221; protested Bab. &#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon,&#8221;
she said blushing. &#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t
know you well enough to say a thing like that to
you. But do let&#8217;s hurry back to camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On their way back they met Gwendolin Morton
and the young German secretary, Franz
Heller. Gwendolin had sprained her ankle in
getting over a log, and had given up her part in
the hunt.
</p>
<p>By midnight nearly all the coon hunters had
returned to the log cabin for repairs before making
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
their way down the hill again. Reginald
Latham sat before the fire drying his wet
clothes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you, Reginald?&#8221;
asked his uncle, sharply. &#8220;We&#8217;ve bagged three
coons, Miss Stuart, but I am afraid we have had
more disasters than good luck. Now, we must
be off home again. Look here, young ladies,&#8221;
said Mr. Latham, turning to Ruth and Mollie,
who were saying good-bye to their guests, &#8220;is
there a wood nymph, who lives anywhere about
in these woods? Several times to-night I
thought I spied a little figure flying between the
trees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Mr. Latham,&#8221; laughed Ruth.
&#8220;Our woods are not haunted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mollie answered never a word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Thurston,&#8221; called Reginald Latham,
as Barbara, who had gone out to change her
wet clothes came into the room to say good night
to her guests, &#8220;may I come up and see you and
your friends in the morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara hesitated. She did not object to
Reginald Latham as the other girls did; she
even thought Ruth, Grace and Mollie were
prejudiced against him, but she had an idea that
something disagreeable might grow out of a
further intimacy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Mr. Latham,&#8221; she exclaimed politely,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
&#8220;but we have planned to do some target
practice in the morning? We are going to stay
but a short time up here in the woods, and Mr.
Stuart, Ruth&#8217;s father, is anxious that we should
learn to shoot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am a fairly good shot myself,&#8221; protested
Reginald Latham. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I come up
and help with the teaching? May I, Miss Stuart?&#8221;
he asked, turning to Ruth, who much
against her will, was obliged to consent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never again shall I allow you to engage in
such an unladylike and cruel sport as a coon
hunt!&#8221; announced Miss Sallie, when the last
guest had gone. The girls agreed with her, as
the baying of the hounds and the noise from the
hunters&#8217; horns at last died away in the distance.

</div>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye Ralph!&#8221; said Barbara, extending
her hand to her old friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Barbara,&#8221; Ralph answered,
politely. &#8220;It has been a great pleasure
for Hugh and me to see you and the other girls
in your forest retreat. I am sorry we must be
off so soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will come back again, in a week or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
two won&#8217;t you?&#8221; begged Ruth. &#8220;I heard you
promise those lovely English girls, Hugh, to take
part in the autumn sports at Lenox.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we shall be back if possible, Ruth.&#8221;
Hugh assured her. &#8220;I think we can promise to
give Lenox a taste of our charming society, say
near the first week in October.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be off, Hugh,&#8221; called Ralph. &#8220;Here
is that Latham fellow coming up the hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab laid her hand on Ralph&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;You
are not angry with me for going off with
Reginald Latham last night are you? Truth of
the matter, Ralph, I don&#8217;t believe I like Mr.
Latham any better than the others do. But I
am rather sorry for him; he seems queer and
nervous. Why, the other day, even at his own
house, all the young people except me ran away
from him. I don&#8217;t think he is very happy.
That&#8217;s why he is always fooling with inventions
and things. He&#8217;s a weak kind of fellow, Ralph,
but I don&#8217;t think he is horrid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ralph laughed and his face cleared. &#8220;Good
for you, Bab. Always looking after the oppressed.
But I don&#8217;t think you need feel sorry
for a fellow who has such a lot of money coming
his way as Reg Latham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t it yet!&#8221; was Bab&#8217;s wise comment.
</p>
<p>As Ralph and Hugh disappeared, Reginald
Latham joined the four girls. He wore his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
shooting clothes, and his dark face was transformed
with pleasure. He knew he was not
popular with young people and the idea made
him unhappy. He had been brought up in a
foreign country and was shy and ill at ease.
His mother had always kept him in her society.
Now, he was delighted with the independence
and courage of &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; and
longed to be friends with them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I am in time for the shooting,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;My uncle sent me up to apologize
for the chapter of accidents that occurred last
night in our coon hunt. Gwendolin Morton is
laid up with a bad ankle, Franz Heller has influenza,
and everyone else is tired out with the
long tramp. But you look entirely rested.&#8221; He
turned to Barbara and spoke under his breath.
&#8220;Forgive me for last night&#8217;s performance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Naki,&#8221; called Ruth to their guide,
&#8220;we are ready for our target practice. Mr.
Latham is here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth led the way over the hill. At a little
distance from the house Naki set up a pasteboard
target, which he nailed to the side of a big
cedar tree, at the edge of a slight embankment.
Below it was nothing but underbrush. No one
was near. It seemed a perfectly safe place for
the rifle practice.
</p>
<p>Mollie sat on the ground back of the eager
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
sportsmen. Nothing could induce her to handle
a gun. &#8220;I suppose I am safe, back here,&#8221; she
laughed, &#8220;so, I shall sit here and watch this famous
shooting match. Only, for goodness&#8217; sake,
all of you be careful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab, Ruth and Grace were each to have ten
shots at the target, Naki showing them how to
load and fire. Reginald Latham would keep the
score. The girl who hit the bull&#8217;s eye the greatest
number of times was to be proclaimed champion.
</p>
<p>Bab fired first. She hit the second ring from
the center of the bull&#8217;s eye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; Ruth cried, taking aim.
But she missed the target altogether. The shot
from her rifle went down the hill.
</p>
<p>Mollie thought she saw something stir. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
this a dangerous business?&#8221; she asked Reginald
Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in these woods to harm,
Miss Mollie,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Most of the birds
have already flown away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For an hour the girls fired at the target.
Grace had grown tired and had taken her seat by
Mollie, but Ruth and Barbara were both enthusiastic
shots. Ruth&#8217;s score stood two ahead of
Bab&#8217;s, who still had three more shots to fire.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Barbara raised her rifle. &#8220;No,
don&#8217;t show me, Naki,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;I think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
I can take aim myself.&#8221; As Bab fired Mollie
rose to her feet with a cry. She had seen something
brown and scarlet moving in the underbrush
on the hill below them.
</p>
<p>Bab&#8217;s shot had missed the target. But did they
hear a low moan like the sound of a wounded
dove?
</p>
<p>Barbara turned a livid white. &#8220;I have hit
something!&#8221; she called to Ruth. But Ruth was
after Mollie, who was scrambling down the hill.
</p>
<p>The whole party followed them, Barbara&#8217;s
knees trembling so that she could hardly
walk.
</p>
<p>There were tears streaming from Mollie&#8217;s
eyes as she looked up at Bab. The child&#8217;s arms
were around a little figure that had fallen in
the underbrush, a little figure in brown and
scarlet, with a wreath of scarlet autumn leaves
in her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been afraid of this,&#8221; said Naki,
pushing the others aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my little Indian girl!&#8221; Mollie explained.
&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t bear to keep away from us, and
at first I thought her the ghost of Lost Man&#8217;s
Trail. I have seen her around our hut nearly
every day; but I promised not to tell you girls
about her. Is she much hurt, Naki?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Better take her to the house and see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>At this Eunice opened her eyes. Her lips
were drawn in a fine line of pain, but she did
not flinch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go home to my own tent,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;I will not enter the abode of my enemies.&#8221;
The little girl struggled out of Mollie&#8217;s
hold and rose to her feet. One arm hung limp
and useless at her side.
</p>
<p>When Reginald Latham touched her, she
shuddered. Tiny drops of blood trickled down
to the ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your handkerchief, please?&#8221; asked
Bab as she went up to Eunice. &#8220;It is I who
have hurt you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;though I did not
mean to do so. Surely you will let me help you
a little if I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She tore open Eunice&#8217;s sleeve and tenderly
wiped the blood. Naki brought two sticks, and,
with his assistance, Bab bound up the wounded
arm, so the blood no longer flowed. &#8220;Now you
must go home to our cabin with us!&#8221; she
pleaded.
</p>
<p>But Eunice broke away from them and
started to flee. She trembled and would have
fallen had not Mollie caught her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See, you can&#8217;t go home alone, Eunice dear,&#8221;
Mollie remonstrated. &#8220;And you must see a
doctor. The bullet from the rifle may still be in
your arm.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>Eunice was obstinate. &#8220;Indians do not need
doctors,&#8221; she asserted.
</p>
<p>But Naki came and took her in his arms. &#8220;We
will take you to your own tent,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;She will rest better there,&#8221; he explained to
the girls, &#8220;and I know the way over the hills.
You may come with me. The Indian squaw, her
grandmother, will be hard to manage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how shall we get a doctor up there?&#8221;
asked Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go down for him later,&#8221; Naki answered
briefly. &#8220;You need have no fear. An
Indian knows how to treat a wound. They have
small use for doctors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your guide an Indian?&#8221; asked Reginald
Latham of Ruth.
</p>
<p>Ruth shook her head. &#8220;He may have some
Indian blood,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it.
But this Indian child, where did she come from?
And to think her name is Eunice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice!&#8221; cried Reginald Latham in a
strange voice. &#8220;Impossible. Why Eunice is
not an Indian name!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is what Mollie called her,&#8221; protested
Ruth. &#8220;And Mollie seems to know who she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham&#8217;s face had turned white.
</p>
<p>Ruth felt her dislike of him slipping away.
He seemed very sympathetic. Mollie, Bab and
Grace were hurrying along after Naki, over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
whose broad shoulder hung the little Indian girl.
Her black hair swept his sleeve, her broken arm
drooped like the wing of a wounded bird.
</p>
<p>Once she roused herself to say. &#8220;My grandmother
will not like these people to come to our
tent. We live alone like the beasts in the forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Barbara, Ruth, Grace and Mollie trudged
on after Naki. While silently by their side
walked Reginald Latham.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE WIGWAM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How much farther must we walk, Naki?&#8221;
asked Mollie, after an hour&#8217;s hard
tramping. &#8220;Surely Eunice and her
grandmother must live somewhere near. Eunice
could not have traveled such a distance to
our hut every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An Indian girl flies like the wind,&#8221; Naki answered.
&#8220;But another half hour will find us at
the wigwam. The Indian woman lives in her
tent. She will have nothing like the white race,
neither house, nor friendships. She is the last
of a lost race. She and the child live alone on
the hill. Sometimes other Indians visit them,
those of the race who have studied and become
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
as white men. They have taught the child what
she knows. But Mother Eunice, as the grandmother
is known, still smokes her pipe by an
open fireside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the old woman also named Eunice?&#8221; Ruth
inquired curiously. &#8220;I do not understand.
Eunice is not an Indian name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham, who was walking next
Ruth, panted with the exertion of climbing the
hill; his breath came quick and fast. He seemed
intent on Naki&#8217;s answer to Ruth&#8217;s simple question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice is a family name in these parts
among a certain tribe of Indians. But you are
right; it is not properly speaking an Indian
name. Many years ago a little girl named
Eunice, the daughter of a white man, was stolen
by the Indians. She grew up by their firesides
and married an Indian chief. In after years,
she would never return to her own people. And
so her children and her children&#8217;s children have
from that day borne the name of Eunice. The
Mohawk Indians have the white man&#8217;s blood as
well as the red man&#8217;s in their veins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie was walking near Eunice, whom Naki
still carried in his arms, and then Mollie would
lean over every now and then and gently touch
the child. Once or twice, during their long
walk, she thought the little Indian girl lost consciousness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
But never once did Eunice moan
or give a cry of pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there,&#8221; said Naki finally, &#8220;lies the Indian
wigwam.&#8221; He pointed in front of him,
where a solitary hill rose before them, shaded
by dense woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see an opening there,&#8221; Ruth
cried; &#8220;neither smoke, nor anything to suggest
that people are living on that hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki smiled wisely. &#8220;The Indians have forgotten
much of their father&#8217;s wisdom,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;But not yet have they forgotten how
to hide in their own forests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I had better go ahead, Naki?&#8221;
Bab queried. &#8220;Some one ought to tell the
grandmother that Eunice is hurt. Since I am responsible
for the accident, it is my place to break
the news to her. I will run on ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not alone, Bab!&#8221; protested loyal Ruth.
&#8220;You are no more responsible for Eunice&#8217;s injury
than the rest of us. It just happened to
be your shot that wounded her. It might just
as easily have been mine. How could we have
dreamed the child was hiding in the underbrush?
I shall go ahead with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better keep with me,&#8221; enjoined Naki.
&#8220;You could not find your way to the wigwam.
We have followed the &#8216;Lost Man&#8217;s Trail.&#8217;
When we get up to the tent, keep a little in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
background. The Indian woman is very old.
She cannot forgive easily. It is best that I explain
to her as well as I can. I will go first,
alone, with the child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice stirred a little on Naki&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;The little one,&#8221; she declared feebly. &#8220;She
of the pale face and the hair like the sun. I
wish her to go with me to the tent of my grandmother.&#8221;
And Eunice pointed with her uninjured
arm toward Mollie.
</p>
<p>Under a canopy formed of the interlaced
branches of great hemlock trees stood an Indian
wigwam. It looked as much a part of the
landscape as the trees themselves. The rains
and the sun had bleached it to an ashen gray.
Outside the tent hung a bunch of arrows.
Against the side leaned a long bow. A fire near
by had been hastily covered over. But nowhere
about was there a sign of human life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your grandmother has heard the footsteps
of strangers approaching,&#8221; Naki said to Eunice.
&#8220;Let her know that you are here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki set the little girl down on her feet. Mollie
stood by her; but Bab, Ruth, Grace and
Reginald Latham were concealed by some thick
bushes a few yards away.
</p>
<p>Eunice spoke a few words in the Indian
tongue. Suddenly the flap of the wigwam
opened, revealing an aged Indian woman. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
looked older than anyone that the girls had ever
seen before. Her brown face was a network of
fine wrinkles; but her black eyes blazed with
youthful fire. She was tall and straight like
the pine trees in her own forest. The old
woman wore an ordinary woolen dress. Over
her shoulders she had thrown an Indian blanket,
striped in orange, black and red. She knew
that strangers were near. But her grandchild
called her!
</p>
<p>At the sight of Eunice the Indian woman gave
a curious cry, which she quickly stifled. In a
voice that only Mollie, who stood near, could
hear she asked: &#8220;My little wood pigeon is
wounded? I have long feared it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie marveled that the old Indian squaw
spoke English.
</p>
<p>Mother Eunice gathered her child in her arms
and carried her within the wigwam, laying her
on a bed of cedar boughs covered with a heavy
blanket. Naki explained that Eunice had been
accidentally shot by a rifle. The old woman
grunted. Without a word she tore down a
bunch of herbs that hung at the side of a wall.
Placing them in an iron pot she went out of her
tent and stirred her fire into a quick blaze.
</p>
<p>All this time the Indian woman had not
spoken to Mollie, nor had she appeared to know
that anyone else was near.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>Mollie had followed Eunice into the wigwam
and knelt by her side. The child moved restlessly.
Mollie leaned over her and unfastened her
dress. Around Eunice&#8217;s neck was an amulet of
gold, each link in the chain carved with curious
Indian characters. At the end of the amulet, on
a square of beaten gold about an inch in size,
was a monogram in English lettering. Mollie
had only time to see that the letters, looked like
E. L. or E. S. She could not tell which, for the
Indian squaw was back in the room, scowling
at her.
</p>
<p>As the grandmother tore the bandage from
the little Indian girl&#8217;s arm and washed the
wound with her healing herbs, Mollie saw that
under the clothing, the child&#8217;s skin was several
shades fairer.
</p>
<p>At last the Indian woman rose up from her
knees. &#8220;Let them come,&#8221; she requested of
Naki. &#8220;Let those who linger in the bushes outside
my wigwam draw near to it. But beware
how they cross the threshold of my tent!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The squaw stood at her own door, waiting to
speak to the girls and Reginald Latham, as they
drew near. &#8220;You have injured my child!&#8221;
she said bitterly. &#8220;Even in times of peace no
Indian seems safe before the bullets of the white
man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab colored deeply. &#8220;I am dreadfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
sorry!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;It was I who hurt your
grandchild. Naki has told you what happened.
How could we know she was hiding near us?
But, now that I have hurt her, you must at least
let us do what we can for her. Naki shall go
down the hill and send a doctor up here to look
at Eunice&#8217;s arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted the squaw. &#8220;An Indian has
no need of the white man&#8217;s doctor. I shall tend
my child. Begone, all of you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham moved back a few paces;
but Bab, Grace and Ruth did not stir.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki,&#8221; Ruth gave her order quietly, &#8220;go
down the hill at once and see that a doctor
comes up to look at this child&#8217;s arm. An
Indian&#8217;s treatment for a bullet wound may be
a good one. I do not know. But I do know I
am not willing that this child should not see a
doctor. Bab and I would feel responsible all
our lives if anything serious resulted from this
accident. Go immediately, Naki,&#8221; Ruth ended.
She was her father&#8217;s daughter. Though she seldom
asserted her authority, there were times
when she insisted on obedience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We want no doctor here,&#8221; the Indian
woman repeated, rocking back and forth. &#8220;No
good comes to the Indian from his white neighbors.
Therefore, have I tried to keep my child
away from them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>But Eunice&#8217;s voice was heard calling inside
the tent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the ladies come in, grandmother. I
wish to have a talk with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sullenly the old woman moved aside and let
the girls and Reginald Latham enter the wigwam.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little brown one,&#8221; Eunice cried, smiling at
Bab, &#8220;you would be almost as brown as I am,
if you lived always in the woods. Do not be so
sorry that you hurt my arm. It was my fault,
not yours. I should not have been in hiding.
I disobeyed the commands of my grandmother.
See, I am better. She will not let a white doctor
look at me, perhaps, because my skin is too
fair for an Indian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Latham,&#8221; Bab turned to Reginald, who
had not spoken. He was looking curiously at
the furnishings of the wigwam, at the Indian
squaw and at Eunice. He did not hear Bab.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Latham!&#8221; Bab called more distinctly,
&#8220;can&#8217;t you persuade&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A curious guttural noise interrupted her.
The old Indian woman&#8217;s eyes were blazing. She
had seized a pine stick in her hand and held it
over Reginald Latham&#8217;s head. &#8220;Out of my
wigwam! Shall your name forever sound in
my ears? Am I not safe in my own house?
Out with you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Reginald Latham had not waited before the
old woman&#8217;s wrath. He was already several
yards down the hill.
</p>
<p>The girls were thunderstruck. Why had the
name of Latham fired this old squaw to such a
burst of fury?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Ruth,&#8221; said Grace, finally. &#8220;Let
us go back home. We shall do no good by
staying here. I suppose we can find our way
home! The old Indian woman seems dreadfully
upset, and our staying can only make matters
worse. Naki will bring the doctor and
attend to everything. Then he will let you know
about Eunice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we had better go,&#8221; Mollie agreed.
&#8220;I know it will be best for Eunice.&#8221; She
kissed the little Indian girl good-bye. &#8220;Tell
your grandmother,&#8221; Mollie explained, &#8220;that
Mr. Latham had nothing to do with the injury
to you. She may have thought he was responsible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; whispered Eunice in Mollie&#8217;s
ear, &#8220;the name of Latham must not be mentioned
in my house. When I first learned to
read I found it written in an old book that told
only the story of the Indian races. My grandmother
tore it from my hand and threw it into
the fire, and said I must never hear that English
name again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Mollie faltered. &#8220;I remember you
did say something about this to me, the first
time I saw you, but I did not think about it. I
do not understand it now. But never mind.
Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; joined Reginald
Latham farther down the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a crazy old thing that Indian woman
is!&#8221; he muttered, laughing nervously. &#8220;She
was only making a scene. She never heard the
name of Latham before in her life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if that is true?&#8221; pondered Mollie
to herself all the way back to their cabin.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>GIVE WAY TO MISS SALLIE!</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie,&#8221; declared Ruth mournfully
about two o&#8217;clock the next day,
&#8220;we are in great trouble!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, what is the matter now?&#8221;
demanded Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Ruth, &#8220;you remember
about the little Indian girl whom Bab accidentally
shot yesterday? Naki has come back from
a visit to her and says she is very ill. He
found the doctor there, who says he won&#8217;t answer
for the child&#8217;s life unless she is taken to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
hospital in the village, where he can see her
often, and where she can have the proper care.
The doctor told Naki we waited too long yesterday
to send for him. He had to probe
Eunice&#8217;s arm to get out the bullet. But she
will be all right if she is only properly looked
after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; declared Miss Sallie, &#8220;the matter is
a very simple one. Have Naki see to it. The
child must be taken to a hospital in Lenox at
once. Everything shall be done for her comfort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, auntie, this is not such a simple
matter to attend to as it seems. The Indian
grandmother positively refuses to let Eunice
be moved. She has kept the child hidden
in these hills all her life, until she believes
Eunice will be eaten up, or run away with,
if once she allows her to go among white people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; sniffed Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all very well for you to say nonsense,
Aunt Sallie, but you do not dream how obstinate
this old woman is. She declares an Indian
does not need treatment from a doctor. In the
meantime, poor little Eunice&#8217;s temperature is
going up, and she is delirious from the fever.
What shall we do? Poor Bab is feeling perfectly
miserable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to this obstinate old woman,&#8221; said
Miss Stuart, firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; cried Ruth, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; answered Aunt Sallie. &#8220;I <i>said</i>,
&#8216;<i>take me</i>.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, auntie, you will so hate the climb up
that trail,&#8221; Ruth argued. &#8220;And the wigwam
is dreadful after you get there. Only the little
Indian girl is exquisite, like a flower growing
in some horrid place. I don&#8217;t believe you will
ever be equal to the trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; insisted Miss Stuart in stately
tones, &#8220;since I have thrown in my fortunes as
chaperon to &#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217; I have had
many strange adventures. Doubtless I shall
have many others. Persuading an obstinate
woman to do what is best for the child she loves
is not an impossible task. It does not matter
in the least whether the woman is white or an
Indian. Tell Naki to take me to the wigwam at
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie, you are an angel!&#8221; cried Ruth,
throwing her arms around her aunt. &#8220;Now,
Bab, don&#8217;t you worry any more,&#8221; she called into
the next room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie does not know what she promises!&#8221;
said Barbara, joining Ruth and her
aunt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just let&#8217;s leave her alone, Bab,&#8221; whispered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Ruth. &#8220;We will go along with her to see
Eunice. I think I am counting on my Aunt
Sallie to win.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart paused to draw one deep breath,
when she finally reached the Indian woman&#8217;s
wigwam. Then she quietly entered the tent
and walked over to Eunice&#8217;s bedside. Crouched
on the floor by the child was the old Indian
squaw, who did not even lift her eyes to look
at Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>Eunice was lying on her cedar bed, with her
cheeks the color of the scarlet leaves that once
crowned her black hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; asked Miss Stuart
politely, bowing to the Indian woman. As
Miss Sallie put her soft hand on Eunice&#8217;s hot
head, the child stopped her restless movements
for a second. The grandmother looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your little girl is very ill!&#8221; Miss Stuart
continued quietly. &#8220;I have come to see that
she has proper care. She must be taken to a
hospital at once. Naki will see to the arrangements.
The doctor says the child must be
moved to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian woman shook her head. &#8220;The
child shall not leave my wigwam!&#8221; she declared,
obstinately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me!&#8221; commanded Miss Stuart,
quietly. Ruth and Barbara stood near her,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
trembling with excitement. &#8220;We mean no
harm to your little girl. Naki will explain
matters to you. But she must be properly
looked after. You are too old to attend to her,
and your wigwam is not a fit place. You declare
your Eunice shall not go away from you
even for a little time.&#8221; Miss Sallie spoke
slowly and impressively. &#8220;If you do not allow
the child to go away, now, for a short time, so
that the doctor can make her well for you, she
will leave you forever!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But still the Indian woman muttered: &#8220;My
child shall not leave my wigwam. Indians
have no need for white men&#8217;s doctors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are alone, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; inquired Miss
Stuart, gently. &#8220;Are not you and your grandchild
the last of your race? Perhaps, if you
had allowed it, the doctors might have kept
other members of your family for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian woman shivered. Miss Stuart
had touched some chord in her memory. She
raised her black eyes to Miss Sallie and spoke
mournfully. &#8220;You are right!&#8221; she asserted.
&#8220;My grandchild and I are the last of a great
race. I am very old and I am now afraid. Let
your white medicine man make my Eunice well
again. But I must follow where the child goes.
Down in the village they will steal her from
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, who would wish to steal her from
you?&#8221; inquired Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>The old woman mumbled. &#8220;An enemy came
to my door but yesterday.&#8221; Then a look of
cunning crossed her face. She spoke childishly.
&#8220;The lady is wise!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Who could
wish to steal a poor little Indian girl? Who in
all this world has a claim on her but her poor
old grandmother? Enough has been said. An
Indian does not like too much talk. The child
and I will go down into the valley to ask the
service of the white doctor. Naki is my friend.
I will do as he says. An Indian can keep a
secret. Naki has long known that my child and
I lived on this hilltop, but he has not betrayed
us. He has not even told his own wife. An
Indian can keep a secret.&#8221; The old woman
rocked back and forth as though well pleased
with herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep whatever secrets you will!&#8221; Miss Sallie
replied. &#8220;It is enough that you will permit
the child to have proper care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; Miss Stuart spoke from the depth
of the largest chair in the living room of their
log cabin. It was nearly dusk and she was
worn out from her long walk to the Indian wigwam.
&#8220;Girls, I want to ask you something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention, girls!&#8221; cried Bab. &#8220;What is it,
Miss Sallie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say,&#8221; continued Miss Stuart,
&#8220;to our going back to civilization? We have
had a beautiful time on our hill. I, for one,
shall long remember it. But the days are
growing shorter. If we are to enjoy Lenox, and
all the delights it offers, don&#8217;t you think it is
about time we were moving there? To tell you
the truth, I have already engaged our board at
the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Aunt Sallie, we have no choice in
the matter, have we?&#8221; asked Ruth, ruefully.
&#8220;I want to enjoy Lenox, too, but I do so hate to
leave this heavenly hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote for Lenox with Aunt Sallie!&#8221; Grace
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensible Grace!&#8221; Miss Stuart murmured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Ruth, dear,&#8221; protested Grace,
&#8220;please don&#8217;t look as if you were offended with
me. We have had a simply perfect time in the
log cabin, but I am just longing to see the
lovely places down in Lenox, and to meet the
delightful people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; Barbara spoke sadly, &#8220;I, too, want
to go down into Lenox now. If Eunice is to be
laid up in the hospital I want to be near her, so
I can find out how she is each day. I shall
never be happy again until I know she is
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie put her arm round her sister. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
you worry so, Bab, dear,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe your shooting poor little Eunice
in the arm is going to do her harm in the end.
Poor little thing! It was simply dreadful for
her to have to spend all her time with her old
Indian grandmother. She never had a chance
to see anybody, or to learn anything. She was
simply sick for companions of her own age.
That is why she was always haunting our cabin.
I don&#8217;t believe Eunice is more than part Indian,
anyway!&#8221; Mollie ended impressively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a
feeling that we shall do her more good, in the
end, from this accident than we have done her
harm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dear!&#8221; cried Bab, already comforted
by her sister&#8217;s prophecy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all against me!&#8221; quoth Ruth, rising.
&#8220;I surrender, as usual, to my beloved
aunt. I want to go to Lenox, but&mdash;I want to be
here on the hill, too. So runs the world. We
can&#8217;t manage to have all the things we want at
the same time; so hurrah for Lenox and the gay
world again! Come here to the door with me,
children. Let us say farewell to our sweet
hillside!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls stood arm in arm on their front
porch. The evening wind swept up the hill and
rustled through the pines. The brook near
their house hurried down the slope into the valley
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
as though it were late for a night&#8217;s engagement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; Barbara declared solemnly, &#8220;whatever
happens to &#8216;The Automobile Girls,&#8217; one
thing is certain, nothing can ever be lovelier
than the weeks we have spent together on this
beautiful hill. Let us kiss all around. Call
Aunt Sallie. She must be a party to the agreement.
We will never forget our little log cabin&mdash;never,
no, never, in all our lives.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>SOCIETY IN LENOX</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie, is Lenox the oldest summer
resort in the United States?&#8221; inquired
Barbara, as they sat on a
private veranda which opened into their own
sitting-room, in the most beautiful hotel in
Lenox.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know, Bab, dear,&#8221; Miss
Sallie answered complacently. &#8220;I think modern
Lenox has been transformed by the wealth
that has come into the place in the last fifty
years. I am told that it once had more literary
associations than any other town in the country.
As Ruth tells me you are ambitious to become a
writer some day, this will interest you. You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
girls must go about, while you are here, and see
all the sights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara blushed and changed the subject.
She did not like to talk of her literary ambitions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth and Mollie are late in getting back,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You know they have
gone over in the automobile to inquire for
Eunice. I hope they will be back in time for
tea. Did Ruth remember to tell you that the
British Ambassador&#8217;s daughters, Dorothy and
Gwendolin Morton, are coming in to tea? And
perhaps Mr. Winthrop Latham and Reginald
Latham will be here also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie nodded. &#8220;Yes; I am expecting
them,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;It is most kind of them
to call on us so promptly. I was afraid we
would know no one in Lenox, as I have no acquaintances
here. I did not expect you and little
Mollie to pull friends down from the sky for
us, as you seem to have done by your rescue
of Mr. Latham and his nephew. What a
strange thing life is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Miss Sallie,&#8221; Barbara continued,
&#8220;it seems awfully funny for Mollie and
me to to be associating with such important
people as the daughters of the English Ambassador.
I am even impressed with that funny
little German Secretary, Franz Heller, just because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
he is attached to the German Embassy.
It makes me feel as though I were a character
in a book, to even meet such clever people.
Dear me, what a lot you and Ruth have done for
us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara, dear,&#8221; replied Miss Stuart, kindly,
&#8220;we have not done much more for you than you
girls have done for us in a different way. True,
through my brother, we happened to have the
money to pay for our good times; but poor Ruth
and I couldn&#8217;t have had those good times
without the other three &#8216;Automobile Girls.&#8217;
How is Grace&#8217;s headache? Will she be able to
see our friends this afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I ask her?&#8221; Bab suggested, going in to
the bedroom through the French window which
opened onto their porch.
</p>
<p>She came out, shaking her head. &#8220;Grace is
not well enough to get up yet,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;She says she may be able to join us for a few
minutes when our guests arrive; but you are not
to worry. Her headache is better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we have tea out on our veranda, Barbara?&#8221;
Miss Sallie asked. &#8220;I cannot tear myself
away from this view. How exquisite the
lake looks down between those mountains.
And what is the name of that hill over there?
Oh, yes, I know you girls have told me the
name of it many times before, but as I cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
remember it, you will probably have to tell it to
me repeatedly. Monument Mountain, did you
say? Oh, I recall the story now. An Indian
girl is supposed to have flung herself off of it
on account of some love affair. Curious people
the Indians,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Do you know,
Bab, I am much interested in our little Indian
girl? She is a very beautiful child, and her
race is not usually beautiful. I don&#8217;t understand
the girl looking as she does. I shall go
to the hospital with you to see her soon. Now,
hurry along, child, and order the tea.&#8221; Miss
Sallie paused for an instant. &#8220;And tell the
waiter to see that the service is good. English
people are so particular about their tea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara was back from her errand just in
time to see a pony carriage drive up in front of
the hotel. She went forward to meet their
guests, sighing a little to herself. &#8220;I do wish
Ruth and Mollie would come. I am sure I
shan&#8217;t know how to talk to these English girls
by myself. I hardly spoke to them the night of
our famous coon hunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gwendolin and Dorothy Morton came half
shyly forward. They were tall, willowy girls,
with soft, brown hair and lovely complexions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why English girls are thought to
look like roses,&#8221; flashed through Bab&#8217;s mind.
&#8220;These girls are just like roses bending from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
long stems.&#8221; Barbara came forward, speaking
in her usual frank fashion. &#8220;I am so glad to
see you,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Will you come to
our little private balcony? If it is not too cold
for you, Miss Stuart wishes to have tea out
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gwendolin and Dorothy Morton followed Bab
in silence. As English girls do not talk so
much as American girls on first acquaintance,
Barbara felt compelled to keep up the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ever so sorry,&#8221; she went on; &#8220;but my
friend, Ruth Stuart, and my sister, Mollie, are
not yet back from the hospital. They have
gone to ask about our little Indian girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your little Indian girl!&#8221; exclaimed Dorothy
Morton, surprised into talking. &#8220;Why, what
do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab glanced back over her shoulder as the
three girls started into the hotel. &#8220;There come
Ruth and Mollie now!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;They
can tell you about our little Eunice better than
lean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A crimson motor car was speeding up the
avenue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How well Miss Stuart drives her car!&#8221;
laughed Gwendolin Morton. &#8220;But she will
have to be very careful; the road laws are very
strict in Lenox. I must tell her that, if she is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
arrested, she will surely be taken to prison. I
don&#8217;t know how to drive a car. My sister and
I are more fond of horses. Do you ride, Miss
Thurston?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara colored. She wondered what these
wealthy English girls would think of the kind
of riding to which she had been accustomed.
An old bareback horse, a Texas pony, once even
a mule had been Barbara&#8217;s steeds. So she answered
shyly: &#8220;Yes, I do ride a little. But, of
course, I don&#8217;t ride in the beautiful way I know
you and your sister do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very anxious to have you and your
friends take part in our autumn sports at
Lenox,&#8221; urged Dorothy Morton.
</p>
<p>Barbara and the two English girls were waiting
at the hotel door for Ruth and Mollie.
</p>
<p>In another moment Ruth jumped from her
car, and, followed by Mollie, came hurrying up
to her guests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry not to be here when you arrived,&#8221;
she explained. &#8220;We just flew home.
I was afraid of being held up every minute. But
we were kept waiting so long at the hospital
that I knew we were late. Do let&#8217;s join Aunt
Sallie. She will grow impatient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart came forward from her veranda
into their private sitting-room. &#8220;I am so glad
to see you,&#8221; she said to the two English girls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And we are delighted to be your first guests,
Miss Stuart,&#8221; said Gwendolin, who was the
elder of the two girls. &#8220;Mr. Heller wishes to
come in and pay his respects to you later, and
I believe Mr. Winthrop Latham and his nephew
are on their way now. We passed them as we
drove here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie,&#8221; Ruth spoke softly a few moments
later, when she thought no one was
listening, &#8220;little Eunice is better. But Naki
had to take her to the hospital at Pittsfield. He
could not find a place for her here. Fortunately,
Pittsfield is only a few miles from Lenox over a
simply perfect road, so we shan&#8217;t mind going
back and forth in the car. Naki and Ceally are
keeping the poor old Indian grandmother with
them. Ceally says she seems subdued and
frightened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth turned rosy red. From the silence in
the room she knew her guests were hearing
what she said. &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; she explained,
turning to Dorothy Morton, who was
nearest her. &#8220;Please forgive my bad manners.
We are so interested in our new protégée that
I forget that you know nothing of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we should like to know, awfully!&#8221;
Dorothy declared. &#8220;Who is this Indian girl?
I thought all the Indians had vanished from the
Berkshires.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>But Mr. Winthrop Latham and his nephew
Reginald were at the door.
</p>
<p>Behind them was a plump little German, with
blond hair parted in the middle, a tiny waxed
mustache and near-sighted blue eyes. He was
Franz Heller, the Secretary at the German Embassy.
He could usually be found somewhere
in the neighborhood of Gwendolin Morton.
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham came up to Bab and sat
down next her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; he whispered immediately, &#8220;do not
speak of the little Indian girl before my uncle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; queried Bab, in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain to you now!&#8221; Reginald faltered.
His uncle&#8217;s eyes were fastened on
him.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart announcing that tea was waiting
on the balcony, the little party adjourned to the
veranda and stood talking and admiring the
view. It was a wonderful, clear October day,
radiant with warm sunshine.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham stood near Miss Stuart,
assisting her to serve the tea. The young people
were talking in a group near them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Ruth!&#8221; exclaimed Dorothy Morton.
&#8220;Forgive my calling you Ruth so early in our
acquaintance, but if I call you Miss Stuart,
your aunt may think I am speaking to her. Do
please tell us about the mysterious little Indian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
girl, who is your protégée. Where did you find
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham, who was near Barbara,
broke into the conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Miss Stuart about our fall sports, Dorothy!&#8221;
he urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me of them afterwards,&#8221; said Dorothy.
&#8220;I must hear about this Indian child first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the story of our little Indian girl is a
long and rather odd one,&#8221; Ruth asserted. &#8220;As
she is really Mollie&#8217;s discovery, not mine, Mollie
must tell you about her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie was embarrassed at suddenly finding
herself the center of so many eyes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham had turned around,
and was also watching her. He had caught
Ruth&#8217;s last speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; confessed Mollie, &#8220;the story of our
little Indian girl is simple enough, but it is very
strange.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little girl paused. Reginald Latham&#8217;s
eyes were fixed on her in a strange gaze; but she
had started to tell her tale and must go on.
Mollie looked over at Aunt Sallie, and the latter
nodded her approval.
</p>
<p>Quietly Mollie told of her wood nymph first
leading her astray on the mountain; of Eunice&#8217;s
visit to her, next day, and of Bab&#8217;s accidental
shooting of the child afterwards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think our discovery of the little
Indian girl was so odd,&#8221; said Mollie. &#8220;What
I think is strange is that no one around here
ever knew of her before. Just think, Eunice is
thirteen or fourteen years old and she has been
kept hidden in these hills by her old Indian
grandmother all her life. She had never been
to a town until she was taken to the hospital
by our guide, Naki. Yet she is so pretty and
gentle. I love her already.&#8221; The little girl
had a queer feeling as if she were defending
Eunice&mdash;she did not know why.
</p>
<p>A voice broke into the conversation. &#8220;You
say, my dear&#8221;&mdash;Mr. Latham spoke sternly&mdash;&#8220;that
you and your friends have found an old
Indian woman and a child called Eunice hidden
in the woods back of you? The thing is impossible.
The old woman and the girl are probably
gypsies or tramps. They cannot be
Indians. I have reason to know the history of
the Indians in this part of the country very well.
My eldest brother married an Indian girl. She
was the last of her people in this vicinity, and
she died about fifteen years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie did not answer. A sudden silence fell
upon the little group.
</p>
<p>Barbara looked at Reginald. She understood,
now, why he was often afraid of his uncle.
The older man would not endure contradiction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Reginald, we must say good-bye to Miss
Stuart,&#8221; his uncle commanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go just yet, Mr. Latham,&#8221; pleaded
Gwendolin Morton. &#8220;You promised to help
me explain to Miss Stuart the plan for our day
of sports. You see, Miss Stuart, every season
at Lenox we have an annual entertainment for
the benefit of our hospital fund. This year
father is to take charge of the sports, which we
try to make just as informal and jolly as possible.
One of the reasons for my call was to ask
you to let your girls help us out with our amusements.
As soon as I told my father we had met
some delightful American girls who were camping
near here, he suggested that we invite them
to join in our sports. We intend to have some
really good riding; but the other games are only
jokes. Did you ever hear of a dummy race or
a thread-and-needle race?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart shook her head, smilingly, as she
said, &#8220;Miss Morton, I don&#8217;t even try to keep
up with the ways young people have of entertaining
themselves these days; but I am sure,
whatever your Lenox sports may be, my &#8216;Automobile
Girls&#8217; will be happy to take part in them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s awfully jolly of you, Miss Stuart!&#8221;
declared Dorothy Morton, who was the younger
and more informal of the English girls. She
turned to Ruth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in and have a game of
archery with us to-morrow afternoon? Father
and mother will both be at home. We can tell
you all of our plans for next week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be happy to come,&#8221; laughed Ruth,
&#8220;but none of us know how to use the bow.
That is an English game, isn&#8217;t it? We shall be
delighted to look on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, archery is all the rage at Lenox,&#8221; little
Mr. Heller explained. &#8220;Perhaps you will
let me show your friends how to shoot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth shook her head. &#8220;We shall have plenty
to learn if we are to take part in your queer
races next week. If my friend, Miss Carter, is
better to-morrow you may expect us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grace came out on the porch. &#8220;I am well,
already!&#8221; she apologized. &#8220;At least I decided
that, headache or no headache, I couldn&#8217;t miss
all the fun this afternoon. So here I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we must positively say good-bye, Miss
Stuart,&#8221; declared Mr. Latham, extending his
hand. &#8220;I want to take you and your girls for a
drive to Lake Queechy. Then you must see the
place where the Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8216;little red house&#8217;
formerly stood. The house burned down some
years ago, but the site is interesting, for Hawthorne
lived in the Berkshires a number of years
and wrote &#8216;The House of Seven Gables&#8217; here.
We have plenty of literary associations, Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Stuart. My people have lived here so long that I
take a deep interest in the history of the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lake Queechy,&#8221; Miss Sallie exclaimed sentimentally,
&#8220;is the lake named for Susan
Warner, the author of &#8216;Queechy&#8217; and &#8216;The
Wide, Wide World.&#8217; Dear me, I shed quantities
of tears over those books in my day. But
girls don&#8217;t care for such weepy books nowadays,
do they? They want more fire and adventure.
I am sure I should be ashamed of my &#8216;Automobile
Girls&#8217; if they fell to crying in the face of
an obstacle. They prefer to overcome it. We
shall be delighted to drive with you. Good-bye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curious, Reginald!&#8221; declared Mr. Winthrop
Latham, when the two men had walked several
yards from the hotel in silence. &#8220;That is a very
remarkable story that your friends tell of the
discovery of an unknown Indian child. Did
they call her Eunice? That is strangest of all!
You have been up on the hill with these girls
a number of times. Have you seen this girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald mumbled something. It was not
audible. But his uncle understood he had not
seen the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, the old woman is probably a gypsy
tramp,&#8221; Mr. Latham concluded, &#8220;but I will look
up the child, some day, for my own satisfaction.
Reg, boy, the rudder of our airship will be repaired
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
in the next few days. Do you feel equal
to another aerial flight?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly I do,&#8221; the nephew replied.
The two men walked on. But, for once, they
were not thinking of their favorite hobby. The
mind of each man dwelt upon Mollie&#8217;s story of
a poor little Indian girl. What connection
could she have with these two men of wealth
and position?
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham&#8217;s suspicions were growing.
The Indian girl might be an obstacle in his path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell mother all I have heard and
guessed,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;Under no circumstances
must uncle be allowed to see this child.
Mother will know how to manage. We may
have to spirit the girl away, if she is the child
I fear she is. But we must make sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reginald Latham was not a pleasant man, but
he was clever. If he had reason to fear little
Eunice he would work quietly. What chance
had the child and her ignorant, uncivilized
grandmother against him?
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham&#8217;s thoughts were of a
different kind. &#8220;The young Indian girl,&#8221; he
assured himself, &#8220;can have no further possible
interest for me.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AT THE AMBASSADOR&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Shall we walk down to the postoffice,
Ruth?&#8221; Barbara asked. &#8220;I am awfully
anxious for a letter from mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go!&#8221; urged Grace. &#8220;We have just
time enough before dressing for our call at the
Ambassador&#8217;s. I am told that everyone goes
for his own letters in Lenox. We shall see all
the social lights. They say titled foreigners
line up in front of the Lenox postoffice to look
for heiresses. Ruth, you are our only heiress.
Here&#8217;s a chance for you!&#8221; teased Grace.
</p>
<p>Ruth looked provoked. &#8220;I won&#8217;t be called
horrid names, Grace Carter!&#8221; she asserted, indignantly.
&#8220;Heiress or no heiress, when my
turn comes for a husband I won&#8217;t look at any
old foreigner. A good American citizen will
be a fine enough husband for me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; laughed Mollie, putting on her
hat. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us quarrel over Ruth&#8217;s prospective
husband just at present. It reminds me
of the old maid who shed tears before the pot
of boiling fat. When her neighbor inquired
what troubled her, the spinster said she was
thinking that if she had ever been married her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
child might have played in the kitchen, and
might have fallen into the pot of boiling oil!
Come on, &#8216;old maid Ruth,&#8217; let&#8217;s be off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls walked briskly through the bracing
mountain air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you will have a letter from Hugh
or Ralph, Ruth,&#8221; Barbara suggested. &#8220;They
told you they would write you if they could
come to Lenox for the week of games.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth went into the postoffice to inquire for
their mail. The other girls waited on the outside.
A tall young woman swept by them, leading
a beautiful English deerhound on a long silver
chain. She had very blond hair and light
blue eyes. Her glance rested on Barbara for
the space of half a second.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; Barbara laughed. &#8220;How very
young and insignificant that intensely superior
person makes me feel! Maybe she is one of the
heiresses Grace told us about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a letter for you, Grace!&#8221; said Ruth,
returning to her friends. &#8220;The one addressed
to you, Bab, is probably for you and Mollie together.
It is from your mother. Then I have
two letters for myself and two for Aunt Sallie.
It is all right; Hugh and Ralph will be here the
first thing next week,&#8221; announced Ruth, tearing
open one of her notes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would Aunt Sallie say if she could see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
us opening our mail on the street?&#8221; queried
Barbara, as she promptly followed Ruth&#8217;s bad
example. &#8220;But this is such a quiet spot, under
these old elms, that I must have a peep at
mother&#8217;s letter. Mother is having a beautiful
time in St. Paul with Cousin Betty, Molliekins,&#8221;
continued Bab. &#8220;And what do you think?
Our queer old cousin is sending us another
present. What has come over her? First she
sends the beautiful silk dresses and now&mdash;but
mother doesn&#8217;t tell what this last gift is. She
says it is to be a surprise for us when we come
back from Lenox.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What fun!&#8221; cried Mollie. &#8220;Our crabbed
cousin is having a slight change of heart. She
has always been dreadfully bored with Bab and
me,&#8221; Mollie explained to Ruth and Grace, &#8220;but
she is devoted to mother, and used to want her
to live with her. But she never could make up
her mind to endure us girls. Tell me some more
news, Bab.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Barbara read on, &#8220;mother has had
a letter from Mr. Stuart; but Ruth&#8217;s letter will
give her this news. He writes that his new gold
mine is a perfect wonder. I am so glad for you,
Ruth, dear!&#8221; Barbara ended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Ruth exclaimed. &#8220;Father is so lucky!
But we really don&#8217;t need any more money.
Just think, father only has Aunt Sallie and poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
me to spend it all on. If he only had a big family
it would be worth while to grow richer and
richer. I wish you were really my sisters.
Then you would let me share some of all this
money with you, Bab dear,&#8221; whispered Ruth in
her best friend&#8217;s ear, as the two girls dropped
behind Mollie and Grace.
</p>
<p>Barbara shook her head. Yet the tears
started to her eyes in spite of the fact that she
was out on the street. &#8220;You generous darling!&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;If you aren&#8217;t sharing your
money with us by giving us all these good
times, what are you doing? But, of course, we
couldn&#8217;t take your money in any other way.
Mollie and I are used to being poor. We don&#8217;t
mind it so very much. Let&#8217;s hurry. Aunt
Sallie will want us to put on our best clothes
for our call at the Ambassador&#8217;s. Thank
goodness for Cousin Betty&#8217;s present to
Mollie and me of the silk suits. We have
never had such fine clothes before in our
lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie,&#8221; inquired Barbara, an hour
later, &#8220;will Mollie and I do for the call at the
Ambassador&#8217;s? You know this is the great
event in our lives. Who knows but the Ambassador
may even shake hands with humble
me! Do Ambassadors shake hands, Aunt Sallie?
Why, &#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217; may meet the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
President some day, we are getting so high in
the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows indeed, Barbara?&#8221; responded
Miss Stuart complacently. &#8220;Far more unlikely
things have often happened. You and Mollie
look very well, dear. Indeed, I never saw you
in more becoming frocks. They are very
dainty and stylish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie,&#8221; confessed Mollie, &#8220;I never
had a silk dress before in all my life. Bab had
one made over from an old one of mother&#8217;s, but
this is positively my first appearance &#8216;in silk
attire.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab&#8217;s costume was of apricot rajah silk, made
with a plaited skirt and a long coat, which
fastened across her chest with a single gilt ornament.
With it she wore a delicate lace blouse
over silk of the same shade as her suit. Her
hat was a large black chip with one long curling
feather.
</p>
<p>Mollie&#8217;s dress was like Bab&#8217;s, except that it
was a delicate shade of robin&#8217;s-egg blue, while
her hat was of soft white felt, trimmed with a
long blue feather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us look at ourselves in the mirror, Bab,
until Miss Sallie is ready,&#8221; whispered Mollie.
&#8220;I want to try to get used to my appearance.
Maybe you think this wealthy-looking person
you now behold is some relative of yours&mdash;possibly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
your sister! But just understand that,
as I look at myself in that mirror, nothing can
make me believe I am poor little Mollie Thurston,
of Kingsbridge, New Jersey! Why, I am
now about to call on the English Ambassador,
younger brother to an earl. But I am a brave
girl. I shall put on as bold a front as possible,
and I shall try not to disgrace Aunt Sallie by
making any breaks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You goose you!&#8221; laughed Bab. &#8220;But to
tell you the truth, sweet Mistress Mollie, I feel
pretty much as you do. There is Ruth calling
us. They are ready to start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, children!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;The automobile
is waiting. My goodness!&#8221; she exclaimed,
as Mollie and Bab appeared before her.
&#8220;How very elegant you look! Don&#8217;t tell me
fine feathers don&#8217;t make fine-looking birds!
Aunt Sallie, I am not magnificent enough to associate
with these two persons.&#8221; Ruth had on
a beautiful white serge suit and Grace a long tan
coat over a light silk dress; but, for the first
time, Mollie and Barbara were the most elegantly
dressed of the four girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;People will be taking <i>you</i> for the heiress,
and marrying you to some horrid titled foreigner!&#8221;
teased Ruth, pinching Mollie&#8217;s pretty
cheek.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart and her girls found the English
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Ambassador and his wife in the stately drawing
room of their summer place in Lenox. The
room was sixty feet in length and hung with
beautiful paintings. The walls and furniture
were upholstered in rose-colored brocade.
Flowers were arranged in every possible place.
</p>
<p>The newcomers had a confused feeling that
there were twenty or thirty guests in the drawing
room; but as the butler announced their
names their hostess moved forward from a
group of friends to speak to them. In another
moment Dorothy Morton spied them, and came
up with her arm through that of a tall, middle-aged
man, very slender, with closely cut blond
hair and a long drooping mustache. He looked
very intellectual and impressive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stuart, this is my father,&#8221; said Dorothy
simply. The Ambassador bowed low over
Miss Stuart&#8217;s hand. He was then introduced to
each of &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; in turn.
</p>
<p>The Ambassador&#8217;s eyes twinkled. He saw
his young guests were a little awed at meeting
so great a diplomatic personage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the girls, aren&#8217;t you, who have been
camping on one of our Berkshire hills?&#8221; the
Ambassador inquired. &#8220;My daughters have told
me about your delightful hut. Curious, I never
heard of the little cabin&#8217;s existence. I want you
to show me the place. Some day I may follow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
your example and run away to the woods for a
few weeks. Dorothy tells me you will help us
with our games next week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart excused herself. Mrs. Latham
wished to talk with her in another part of the
drawing room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May we count on you for the Gymkana
races, Ruth?&#8221; asked Dorothy Morton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gymkana races!&#8221; questioned Ruth, shaking
her head. &#8220;What in the world can you
mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; laughed her hostess, &#8220;I told
you our sports were to be a huge joke. You
must have a sense of humor, or you won&#8217;t want
to take part. You know we have horse show
grounds here in Lenox. Well, the Gymkana
race this year will take place over their meadow.
Indeed, all the sports are to be held there.
Father, you explain what the games are like,&#8221;
Dorothy requested.
</p>
<p>The Ambassador looked very grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stuart,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;will you or your
friends drive a turkey, a duck, a hen, or a gander
in our Gymkana race? My daughter,
Dorothy, has, I believe, reserved an old gray
goose as her especial steed; but you can make
any other choice of racer that you may desire.
The only point of the game is to get the nose of
your steed first under the blue ribbon. It may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
take a good deal of racing and chasing on your
own part to accomplish it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy inquired, turning first to Ruth, then
to Bab, Mollie and Grace, &#8220;May I put down your
names for this race?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth laughed. &#8220;Certainly I shall enter,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;I have as good a nerve as anyone
else. You must give me time to decide on
what animal I shall drive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll join, too!&#8221; Grace agreed. &#8220;Is this
game for women only?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Dorothy replied. &#8220;Other distinguished
sports are reserved for the men. What do
you think of my serious-minded father? He is
down for the &#8216;egg and spoon&#8217; race. So are
Franz Heller and Mr. Winthrop Latham. I
mean to ask your two men friends, Mr. Post and
Mr. Ewing, to enter, too. It&#8217;s great sport. The
men have to run across the track carrying a
raw egg in a desert spoon. The man who first
gets to the winning post without a mishap is
the winner. But there will be other games as
well. I am just mentioning a few of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gwendolin Morton approached with Franz
Heller and the tall blond girl whom &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; had seen for a moment at the
postoffice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to come to believe in the American
fashion of introducing our friends,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Miss Morton. &#8220;You know, in England it is not
the custom to introduce people to one another at
a tea party. May I present my friend, Maud
Warren, to you, Miss Stuart, Miss Carter, and
the Misses Thurston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The four girls bowed. Maud Warren inclined
her head slightly, giving each girl in turn
a supercilious stare.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose father and Dorothy have been
persuading you to take part in the nonsensical
side of our entertainment next week,&#8221; inquired
Gwendolin. &#8220;I am trying to look after the riding.
Do any of you ride horseback well enough
to go in for the hurdle jumping? I warn you,
you will find it difficult to win. Miss Warren is
one of the best riders in New York. She has
taken prizes at hurdle jumping before, at her
riding school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth declined. &#8220;I am afraid no one of us
rides well enough to go in for this contest. I
ride, of course, but I am not equal to the jumping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth spied Barbara looking at her with longing
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Bab!&#8221; Ruth laughed.
&#8220;I had no right to decline the hurdle jumping
for all of us. Would you like to try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I should like to try!&#8221; Barbara
exclaimed. &#8220;But I know it is out of the question.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
I have no horse, and I haven&#8217;t a riding
habit here.&#8221; Barbara turned shyly to the Ambassador.
&#8220;I have never done any real hurdle
jumping,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;But I have jumped
over all kinds of fences riding through the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Ambassador smiled. &#8220;You need no better
training for hurdle races,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If a horse is what you need,&#8221; cried Dorothy
Morton, &#8220;why not use one from our stables.
We have a number of riding horses. Do let me
lend you one and enter the hurdle jumping contest.
It is a dangerous amusement, however. I
won&#8217;t try it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not in the least afraid,&#8221; Bab declared.
&#8220;Only, if I am left at the post, and
can&#8217;t take a single hurdle, you must forgive
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you understand,&#8221; finished the Ambassador,
&#8220;our amusements are only for our own
friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Mollie,&#8221; called Miss Stuart,
from her corner of the room, where she was
seated near Mrs. Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; explained Miss Sallie, as the child
approached, &#8220;Mrs. Latham is much interested
in our little Indian girl. Her son, Reginald,
has told her of the accident to Eunice. Mrs.
Latham is anxious to know to what hospital in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Pittsfield Naki has taken the child. I did not
ask Ruth. Can you tell us the name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie looked at Mrs. Latham steadily. The
older woman dropped her eyes. &#8220;Eunice is not
yet allowed to see visitors,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have no wish to call on the child,&#8221; Mrs.
Latham protested, &#8220;but if the Indian girl and
her old grandmother are in want I shall send a
man to look after them. My brother is most
generous to the poor, Miss Stuart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mollie went on. &#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Latham,
but Eunice and her grandmother are not
poor. Ruth is looking after them now. The
grandmother wishes to take Eunice back to their
wigwam on the hill, when the little girl is well
enough to be moved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Latham frowned. She had her own reasons
for wishing to discover the address of the
Indian woman and her child. Yet she did not
want to appear to be much interested.
</p>
<p>Barbara came up to join Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sister seems determined that no one
shall take interest in your little Indian protégée
except her own friends,&#8221; declared Mrs. Latham,
smiling at Bab. &#8220;Perhaps you would not
object to telling me where the child is located.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why certainly not!&#8221; Barbara exclaimed
frankly, looking in surprise at Mollie.
</p>
<p>But Mollie interrupted her. The little girl&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
cheeks were burning hot. She was conscious of
her own bad manners, and of Miss Stuart&#8217;s look
of disappointment. Yet she spoke before Bab
could continue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for Mrs. Latham to think I am
rude in not telling her where Eunice is staying;
but it seems to me that, if her old Indian grandmother
has kept Eunice hidden all these years,
she must have had some good reason. It does
not seem fair to me for us to talk about her just
because, through an accident, we had to send
her to town. I think, if the grandmother wishes
to keep Eunice hidden, we ought at least to ask
the old woman&#8217;s permission before we tell anyone
where she is staying. I am awfully sorry,&#8221;
Mollie ended, apologetically, &#8220;but I do feel that
I am right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Latham was very angry. &#8220;I am sure
I beg your pardon, Miss Thurston,&#8221; she rejoined
icily, before she moved away. &#8220;I meant nothing
by my harmless inquiry. I can assure you
I am not unduly interested in your protégée. If
you wish to keep the gypsy girl&#8217;s hiding place
a secret, do so, by all means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, I am exceedingly angry with you!&#8221;
said Miss Sallie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you be so horrid, Mollie?&#8221; whispered
Bab.
</p>
<p>Mollie&#8217;s blue eyes were swimming in tears,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
but she would not let them fall on her flushed
cheeks. She knew she must say good-bye to her
new acquaintances, so she dared not answer Miss
Sallie then.
</p>
<p>But on the way back to their hotel, seated
next Miss Stuart in the automobile, Mollie tried
to offer an explanation for her rude behavior.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie,&#8221; she pleaded softly, &#8220;I know
you are dreadfully angry with me; and I am
afraid you won&#8217;t forgive me; but I just couldn&#8217;t
make up my mind to let Mrs. Latham know
where to find Eunice and her old grandmother.
I know you will think I am foolish. Perhaps I
am. But I have a feeling that Reginald Latham
and his mother mean no good to Eunice.
I can&#8217;t help remembering how the old squaw
acted when she first heard the name of Latham.
I cannot believe she was just acting
for effect as Reginald Latham said she
was. There is some mystery about little
Eunice. Do you think, Miss Sallie, we girls
have a right to betray the old Indian woman&#8217;s
secrets?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sympathies are all with Mollie, Aunt
Sallie!&#8221; Ruth declared. &#8220;I shall have to come
in for a share of her scolding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Barbara shook her head. &#8220;I never knew
anyone so prejudiced as Mollie is against Reginald
Latham. What on earth do you suppose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
he and his mother could have against a poor old
squaw and her little girl? Would you have
helped pulled Reginald down out of his airship,
if you had known how you would dislike him,
Mollie?&#8221; Bab asked.
</p>
<p>But Mollie was looking wistfully at Miss Sallie,
and did not heed Barbara&#8217;s question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what a young girl may think
on any subject,&#8221; Miss Stuart declared firmly,
&#8220;she has no right to be rude to an older woman.
And Mollie was undeniably rude to Mrs. Latham
in refusing to answer her simple question. It
could have done no harm to have told her the
name of the hospital where Eunice is being
treated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t have done Eunice any harm
to tell that much, Mollie,&#8221; Ruth agreed, &#8220;because,
if that very determined Mrs. Latham
wishes to discover where little Eunice is, she
will certainly accomplish it. Why, she rules her
grown-up son with a rod of iron!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark my words!&#8221; said Grace, joining
quietly in the conversation&mdash;Grace was not often
given to expressing an opinion, so even Miss
Sallie listened to her with respect. &#8220;I would
like to bet a great big box of candy that Mrs.
Latham sees Eunice and her Indian grandmother
before they are many weeks older. The
Lathams have some connection with little Eunice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
though goodness knows I can&#8217;t guess what it
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie had nothing more to say. She was in
the motor car now. Her tears could flow freely.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie pretended, for a few moments, not
to see that Mollie was crying. A breach in social
etiquette was a sore offense to Miss Stuart.
But after a little while she put her arm around
the little girl and gave her a gentle squeeze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will forgive you, this time, dear,&#8221; she murmured,
&#8220;but I never want you, Mollie, to be
rude to a grown person again. And I don&#8217;t
think, my dear, it is a good idea to have a suspicious
nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be rude,&#8221; Mollie sighed,
putting her head against Miss Stuart&#8217;s arm. &#8220;I
was only trying not to tell Mrs. Latham what
she wanted to know.&#8221; Because it was now dark,
and Mollie could not see her face, Miss Sallie
smiled.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A VISIT TO EUNICE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;O girls, I have had the most splendiferous
time!&#8221; cried Bab, bounding into
the hotel sitting room. She wore
Ruth&#8217;s tan colored riding habit and a little
brown derby. Her curls were drawn up in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
knot at the back of her head. Her brown eyes
were sparkling. She pranced into the room, as
though she were still on horseback.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie, I never knew what horseback
riding could mean until to-day. Dorothy Morton
has lent me a perfect dream of a horse.
Its name is Beauty. It is black and slim and
has a white star on its nose. My, don&#8217;t I wish
it were mine! Well, Beauty and I took our
hurdles to-day, at the Ambassador&#8217;s farm, as
though we had been jumping together all our
lives. See, here!&#8221; Barbara vaulted lightly over
a low stool, and stood in the center of the room,
brandishing her riding crop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara Thurston!&#8221; Mollie exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; protested Bab. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
dream we had a visitor. I am so sorry! I have
been practising for the hurdle jumping next
week,&#8221; Bab ended tamely.
</p>
<p>A stout man, with iron gray hair and a kindly
expression, smiled at Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mind my presence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have a daughter of my own who is fond of horseback
riding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara,&#8221; explained Miss Stuart, &#8220;this is
Doctor Lewis. He has been good enough to
come over from the hospital to tell us about
Eunice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara noticed that Ruth, Grace and Mollie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
had been listening to the doctor with absorbed
attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian girl has asked for her friends
several times in the last few days,&#8221; the doctor
continued, &#8220;but she has not been well enough to
be permitted to talk. The nurses tell me the
child had been most patient. They are much
attracted toward her. Now, I think it may do
the little girl good to see you. Naki, your guide
has explained to me the circumstances of your
finding of the child. It is most remarkable.
But I wonder if you are really interested in the
girl, or whether you are being kind to her, now,
only because of her accident?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask me, doctor?&#8221; Miss Stuart
inquired quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; the doctor answered honestly,
&#8220;I am much interested in the child myself. I
would like to know that she has friends. The
grandmother, stupid and ignorant though she is,
seems devoted to the child. As for Eunice herself,
she is an enigma. She is not in the least
like the grandmother. The old Indian woman
is probably of mixed white and Indian blood,
but the child has less Indian blood. Eunice
must have had a white mother or father. I have
asked the child about her parents, but she
knows absolutely nothing about them, and the
Indian woman will not tell. She told me, very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
decidedly, that it was not my business to inquire;
that I was to make Eunice well after which she
and her grandchild would go back to their wigwam
and live in peace. But that beautiful little
girl ought not to grow up in entire ignorance.
She should be educated, and given an opportunity
to develop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, doctor,&#8221; Miss Sallie rejoined,
&#8220;but the case will present difficulties.
The old grandmother is the child&#8217;s natural
guardian. She will never be persuaded to give
her up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; declared Ruth shyly, &#8220;if it were
possible I should love to educate little Eunice.
I could send her to school and do whatever is
best for her. But I am afraid we have no
right to do it for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I cannot recommend kidnapping the
child, Miss Ruth,&#8221; the doctor replied, &#8220;but, perhaps,
you girls can persuade the old Indian to be
less obstinate. Come and see my little charge
when you can. She is quite well enough to see
you. I shall not have to keep her at the hospital
a great while longer. Her arm is still bandaged.
She will soon be able to walk about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Sallie,&#8221; Ruth asked, as soon as the doctor
left, &#8220;may I have Eunice up at the hotel with
us, as soon as she is well enough to leave the
hospital?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Miss Sallie demurred. &#8220;I must see the child
again first, Ruth, dear. She can come here for
the day, but not longer. She will be best with
Naki and Ceally for a time. Now, Ruth, don&#8217;t
be so impetuous. You must not plan impossible
schemes. Remember, this Indian child is entirely
uneducated. She does not know the first
principles of good manners. But I am perfectly
willing that you should do what seems
best for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When shall we go to see Eunice?&#8221; Ruth
asked, turning to the other three girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let us go this afternoon, please, Ruth,&#8221;
pleaded Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Latham has asked us to go driving
with him,&#8221; Barbara objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Latham has only asked Aunt Sallie and
one of us, Bab,&#8221; Ruth rejoined. &#8220;Suppose
you go with Aunt Sallie. Reginald Latham
would rather have you along. And, to tell you
the truth, Grace and Mollie and I would much
rather go to see Eunice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie and Grace both nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to be left out of the visit
to Eunice, either,&#8221; Bab protested. &#8220;Never
mind,&#8221; she went on, lowering her voice; &#8220;if
Reginald Latham has any connection with Eunice,
see if I don&#8217;t find it out this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, Bab!&#8221; cried Grace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just you wait and see!&#8221; ended Mistress
Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie, you go into the room to see Eunice
first,&#8221; said Ruth as they reached the hospital.
&#8220;Grace and I will wait outside the door. You
can call us when you think we may come in.
Eunice may be frightened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ruth need not have feared.
</p>
<p>As Mollie went into her room, Eunice was sitting
up in bed. Her straight black hair was
neatly combed and hung over her shoulders in
two heavy braids. The child had on a fresh
white night gown. Already she looked fairer
from the short time spent indoors.
</p>
<p>Eunice stretched out her slim brown hands to
Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My little fair one!&#8221; she cried rapturously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared never to see you again. My grandmother
told me I must return to the wigwam as
soon as I am well; but I do not want to leave
this pretty bed. See how white and soft it
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie kissed Eunice.
</p>
<p>The child looked at her curiously. &#8220;Why do
you do such a strange thing to me?&#8221; asked
Eunice.
</p>
<p>Mollie was amazed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what
a kiss is, Eunice? I kissed you because I am
fond of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>Eunice laughed gleefully. &#8220;Indians do not
kiss,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;But I like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I ask the other girls to come in?&#8221; Mollie
inquired. &#8220;My two friends, Ruth and Grace,
are waiting in the hall. They wish to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice nodded. &#8220;I like to see you while
grandmother is away,&#8221; she confided. &#8220;Grandmother
says it is not wise for me to talk so much.
But it is hard to be all the time so silent as the
Indians are. Some days I have talked to the
wild things in the woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth dropped a bunch of red roses on Eunice&#8217;s
bed.
</p>
<p>The child clutched them eagerly. &#8220;It is the
red color that I love!&#8221; she cried in delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; Ruth asked, &#8220;do you remember
your father and mother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;I remember no
one,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Long ago, there was an old
Indian man. He made canoes for me out of
birch bark. He was my grandmother&#8217;s man&mdash;husband,
I think you call him in your language.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three &#8220;Automobile Girls&#8221; were disappointed.
Eunice could remember no associations
but Indian ones. There was nothing to
prove that Eunice was not an Indian except the
child&#8217;s appearance.
</p>
<p>Mollie decided to make another venture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;do you still wear the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
gold chain around your neck? I saw it the day
you were hurt. It is so pretty I should like you
to show it to my friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian girl looked frightened. &#8220;You
will not tell my grandmother?&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;She would be very angry if she knew I wore
it. I found the pretty chain, one day, among
some other gold things in an old box in the wigwam.&#8221;
Why! Eunice pointed in sudden excitement
to the watch Ruth wore fastened on the
outside of her blouse&mdash;&#8220;there was a round shiny
thing like that in the box. The other golden
ornaments are at the wigwam. Only this chain
is Indian. So there seemed no wrong in my
wearing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice slipped her chain from under her
gown. Ruth and Grace examined it closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; Grace exclaimed, &#8220;there are two
English letters engraved on the pendant of
your chain. They are E. L., I am pretty
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same letters are on all the gold things,&#8221;
Eunice declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, E. stands for Eunice plainly enough,&#8221;
volunteered Ruth, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t guess what the
L. means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie said nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Ruth,&#8221; protested Grace, &#8220;the initials
may not be Eunice&#8217;s. The child only found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
the chain at the wigwam. There is no telling
where the jewelry she speaks of came from.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Ruth cried, in a disappointed tone, &#8220;I
never thought of that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice, we must go now,&#8221; announced Ruth,
&#8220;but I want you to promise me not to go back
to the wigwam with your grandmother until you
have first seen me. Tell your grandmother I
wish to talk with her. I want you to come to
see where I live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;I should be
afraid,&#8221; she replied simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not afraid with me, Eunice,&#8221;
Mollie said. &#8220;If you will promise to come to
see us, when you are better, you shall stay right
by me all the time. Will you promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; agreed the child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki is to let me hear as soon as you are
well enough to leave the hospital,&#8221; said Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O Ruth,&#8221; whispered Mollie. &#8220;Eunice will
have no clothes to wear up at the hotel, even to
spend the day. Shall I send her a dress of
mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; Ruth asked, &#8220;do you know what
a present is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a present is something that comes in
a box, and is soft and warm this time,&#8221; Ruth
explained. &#8220;Eunice must wear the present
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
when she is ready to leave the hospital. When
you are well enough to come to see us, I am coming
to the hospital for you. I am going to take
you flying to the hotel where we are staying, on
the back of a big red bird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make fun,&#8221; said the Indian solemnly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You just wait until you see my motor car,
Eunice!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;It is the biggest bird,
and it flies as fast as any you have ever seen.
So do please hurry up and get well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, now. I did not wish to get well before,&#8221;
Eunice replied. &#8220;It is cold and lonely
up on the hill in the snow time.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>PLANS FOR THE SOCIETY CIRCUS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ralph and Hugh! I am so delighted
to see you!&#8221; cried Mollie Thurston, a
few days later. She was alone in
their sitting room writing a letter, when the two
friends arrived. &#8220;We girls have been dreadfully
afraid you would not arrive in time for our
Society Circus. You know the games take place
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is a &#8216;Society Circus&#8217; we have come
to! So that is the name Lenox has given to its
latest form of social entertainment?&#8221; laughed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Hugh. &#8220;Sorry we couldn&#8217;t get here sooner,
Mollie; but you knew you could depend on our
turning up at the appointed time. Where are
the other girls and Aunt Sallie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are over at the Fair Grounds, watching
Bab ride,&#8221; Mollie explained. &#8220;Ralph, I am
awfully worried about Bab. One of the amusements
of the circus is to be a riding contest.
Of course, Bab rides very well, but I don&#8217;t think
mother would approve of her undertaking such
dangerous riding as jumping over hurdles.
Ambassador Morton has told Aunt Sallie that
there will be no danger. He is used to English
girls riding across the country; and I know, at
the riding schools in New York, they give these
same contests; but we have never had any riding
lessons. I can&#8217;t help being nervous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry, Mollie,&#8221; Ralph replied
kindly. &#8220;I am sure Bab is equal to any kind
of horseback exercise. Remember the first time
we saw her, Hugh? She was riding down the
road in the rain, astride an old bareback horse.
We nicknamed her &#8216;Miss Paul Revere&#8217; then and
there. There isn&#8217;t any use trying to keep Bab
off a horse, Mollie, when she has the faintest
chance to get on one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then,&#8221; laughed Mollie, smiling at
the picture Ralph&#8217;s remark had brought to her
mind. &#8220;We will walk over to the Fair Grounds.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
You will find nearly everybody we know in
Lenox over there. You remember that you boys
gave Ruth and Bab liberty to put your names
down for any of the games; come and find out
what trouble they have gotten you into. You
never dreamed of such absurd amusements as
we are to have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are game for anything,&#8221; Hugh declared.
&#8220;Lenox sports are the jolliest I have yet
run across. Don&#8217;t think any other place can
produce anything just like them. Certainly
the amusements are a bit unconventional, but
they are all the more fun. &#8216;Society Circus&#8217; is a
good name for the entertainment. Anything
goes in a &#8216;Society Circus.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What curious amusements people <i>do</i> have
for the benefit of charities!&#8221; reflected Mollie.
&#8220;But I expect the Lenox Hospital will receive a
great deal of money from the sports this year.
You see, they are in charge of the English Ambassador.
That alone would make the entertainment
popular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mollie growing worldly wise, Hugh?&#8221;
asked Ralph, with mock horror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it, Ralph,&#8221; was the reply.
</p>
<p>The boys and Mollie found Barbara in the
midst of a gay circle of young people. Grace
and Ruth were nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>Aunt Sallie sat with Mrs. Morton in the grandstand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
The Ambassador and Mr. Winthrop
Latham wandered about near them. Many
preparations were necessary for the next day&#8217;s
frolic.
</p>
<p>In front of the grandstand stretched a wide,
green field, enclosed with a low fence. A little
distance off stood the club house.
</p>
<p>Bab came forward with both hands extended
to greet her friends. She gave one hand to
Ralph, the other to Hugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad to see you!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t wait to shake your hands in the right way.
We girls were so afraid you had turned &#8216;quitters&#8217;!
Come, this minute, and see Aunt Sallie.
You must be introduced, too, to Ambassador
and Mrs. Morton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are Ruth and Grace?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over yonder,&#8221; laughed Bab, pointing to the
green inclosure in front of them.
</p>
<p>The boys spied Ruth and Grace some distance
off. The two girls were deep in conversation
with a farm boy. Strutting around near them
were a fat turkey gobbler and a Plymouth Rock
rooster.
</p>
<p>Just at this moment Ruth was giving her instructions.
&#8220;Be sure you bring the turkey and
the rooster over to the Fair Grounds by ten
o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>The boy grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have &#8217;em here sure,
Miss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; asked Grace, as the two girls started
back across the meadow to join their friends,
&#8220;do you suppose it will be unkind for us to try
to drive these poor barnyard fowls across a
field before so many people? I presume the
poor old birds will be frightened stiff. Whoever
heard of anything so utterly absurd as a
Gymkana race.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you tender-hearted Grace,&#8221; Ruth assured
her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the kind of pets we
are to drive to-morrow will be much affected
by our efforts. Indeed they are likely to lead
us more of a chase than we shall lead them.
And I don&#8217;t believe the annoyance of being run
across this field by us for a few yards equals the
nervous shock of being scared by an automobile
or a carriage. That alarm may overtake
poor Brother Turkey and Mr. Rooster any day.
I think our race is going to be the greatest fun
ever! Why! I think I see Ralph Ewing and
Hugh over there with the girls. Isn&#8217;t that
great?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Morton!&#8221; Hugh was protesting gayly,
as Grace and Ruth joined the crowd of their
friends. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that Barbara
and Ruth have put Ralph&#8217;s name and mine
down for three of your performances? How
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
shall we ever live through such a tremendous
strain! Kindly explain to me what is expected
of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy Morton got out her blankbook,
where she had written each item of the next
day&#8217;s programme. &#8220;Well, Mr. Post, you and
Mr. Ewing are down for three of our best
events, &#8216;The Egg and Spoon Race,&#8217; &#8216;The
Dummy Race&#8217; and &#8216;The Thread and Needle
Race.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; declared Ralph, meekly accepting
his fate, &#8220;but will you kindly tell me what a
Thread and Needle Race is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very easy task, Ralph, compared
with what Grace and I have undertaken,&#8221; Ruth
assured him. &#8220;All you do, in the &#8216;Thread and
Needle Race,&#8217; is to ride across this field on
horseback carrying a needle. Of course, the
real burden is on the woman. It always is.
Some fair one is waiting for you at the end of
your ride; she must sew a button on your coat.
The sooner she can accomplish this, the better;
for back you must ride, again, to the starting
place, with the button firmly attached to your
coat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sew the button on for me, Mollie?&#8221;
Ralph begged. He saw that Mollie was taking
less part in the amusements than the other
girls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; agreed Mollie. &#8220;I accept your
proffered honor. To tell you the truth, you
stand a better chance of winning with my assistance.
I am a much better seamstress than
Bab.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bab, will be busy winning the riding
prize,&#8221; declared Ralph under his breath, smiling
at his two friends, Mollie and Barbara.
</p>
<p>Maud Warren, the New York girl famous for
her skillful riding, was standing near them, talking
with Reginald Latham. As she overheard
Ralph&#8217;s remark, a sarcastic smile flitted across
her pale face. She had ignored Bab since their
introduction at the Ambassador&#8217;s; but the
thought of this poor country girl&#8217;s really knowing
how to ride horseback was too much for
her.
</p>
<p>Barbara caught Maud Warren&#8217;s look of
amusement and blushed furiously. Then she
turned to Ralph and said aloud, &#8220;Oh, I am not
a rider when compared with Miss Warren.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in comparisons, Miss Thurston,&#8221;
declared the Ambassador, who had
walked up to them. &#8220;But I think you are an
excellent horsewoman. And I much prefer
your riding in the old-fashioned way with a side
saddle. I have observed that it is now fashionable,
in Lenox, for the young women to ride
astride.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; Miss Stuart declared, &#8220;it is luncheon
time. We must return to the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, does everybody understand about to-morrow?&#8221;
asked Gwendolin Morton, when the
last farewells had been said. &#8220;Remember, the
Gymkana race is first. We started with this
spectacle for fear the girls who have promised
to take part might back out. Then, immediately
after lunch, we shall have our horseback riding
and jumping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I have been wise in permitting
you to engage in this horseback riding,
Barbara,&#8221; Miss Stuart declared on their way
home. &#8220;I am afraid this jumping over fences
is a dangerous sport. And I am not sure it is
ladylike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But English girls do it all the time, Aunt
Sallie. Jumping hurdles is taught in the best
riding schools.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had no lessons, Bab. Are you
perfectly sure you do not feel afraid?&#8221; queried
Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, perfectly, dear Aunt Sallie,&#8221; Bab
assured her.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE OLD GRAY GOOSE</h3>
</div>

<p>The day for the Lenox sports dawned clear
and beautiful. By breakfast time the
mists had rolled away from the hilltops.
The trees, which were now beginning to show
bare places among their leafy branches, beheld
their own reflections in the lakes that nestled
at the feet of the Lenox hills.
</p>
<p>From their veranda Miss Stuart and her girls
could see every style of handsome vehicle gliding
along the perfect roads that led toward the
Fair Grounds from the beautiful homes surrounding
the old township.
</p>
<p>The Society Circus could be enjoyed only
by invitation. The tickets had been sent
out only to the chosen. An invitation meant
the payment of five dollars to the Hospital
Fund.
</p>
<p>Barbara was the first of the girls to be ready
to start to the Fair Grounds. She wore the
tan riding-habit that Ruth had loaned her. She
was not to ride until later in the day, but it
would not be feasible to return to the hotel to
change her costume.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart and her party had been asked to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
be the guests at luncheon of Ambassador and
Mrs. Morton.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Grace were dressed in short skirts,
loose blouses, and coats. They, also, looked
ready for business. So only Miss Stuart and
Mollie were able to wear the handsome toilets
suited to the occasion. Mollie appeared in her
blue silk costume. Miss Sallie was resplendent
in a pearl gray broadcloth and a hat of violet
orchids.
</p>
<p>At half-past nine, Hugh Post and Ralph
Ewing knocked at Miss Stuart&#8217;s sitting-room
door. Barbara had already seen Ruth&#8217;s and
Hugh&#8217;s automobiles waiting for them on the
hotel driveway. The boys were impatient to
be off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly explain to me, Ruth,&#8221; asked Hugh, as
the party finally started, &#8220;why you are carrying
those two large bolts of ribbon? Are you
going into the millinery business to-day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth laughed. &#8220;Remember, if you please,
that Grace and I are going in for a much more
serious undertaking. These ribbons are the
reins that we intend to use for our extraordinary
race to-day. I shall endeavor to drive my
turkey with blue strings. Grace considers red
ribbon more adapted to the disposition and appearance
of a rooster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you girls certainly have nerve to take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
part in such a wild goose chase!&#8221; laughed the
boy.
</p>
<p>At the Fair Grounds Miss Stuart had reserved
seats for her party near the green inclosure.
Just in front of them was a little platform,
decorated in red, white and blue bunting.
On this were seated the Ambassador,
Franz Heller, Mr. Winthrop Latham, Reginald
and several other prominent Lenox residents.
</p>
<p>Grace and Ruth were not allowed to remain
with their friends; they were immediately hurried
off to the clubhouse, where they found
eight other girls waiting for them. The entrance
of the ten girls, driving their extraordinary
steeds, was to be the great opening
event of the Society Circus.
</p>
<p>At ten-thirty Mr. Winthrop Latham announced
the first feature of their entertainment.
</p>
<p>A peal of laughter burst from hundreds of
throats.
</p>
<p>Marching from the clubhouse were ten pretty
girls, &#8220;shooing&#8221; in front of them ten varieties
of barnyard fowls!
</p>
<p>Dorothy Morton walked along in a stately
fashion, led by an old gray goose. Neither
Miss Morton nor the goose seemed in the least
degree disturbed by the applause and laughter.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s turkey was not so amiable. It
stopped several times in its promenade from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the clubhouse, to crane its long neck back
at the driver. The turkey&#8217;s small eyes surveyed
the scene about it with a look of mingled suspicion
and indignation. The old rooster, which
regarded the occasion as given in its honor,
traveled in front of Grace at a lively pace.
</p>
<p>Within the inclosed field, just in front of the
little stand, where the Ambassador and his
friends sat, two poles had been placed ten yards
apart. Across the meadow, about an eighth of
a mile, were two other poles of the same kind.
</p>
<p>The girls were to try to persuade their curious
steeds to run across the field from the first
posts to those opposite. There the drivers were
expected to turn their steeds and come safely
back to the starting place.
</p>
<p>Of the ten entrances Grace and her rooster
made the best start. Ruth&#8217;s turkey refused to
stir; he had found a fat worm on the ground in
front of him. His attention was riveted to that.
Ruth flapped her blue silk reins in vain.
</p>
<p>But a peacock bore the turkey company.
Seeing himself and his barnyard acquaintances
the center of so many eyes, Mr. Peacock was
properly vain. He spread his beautiful fan-shaped
tail, and would not be driven from the
starting-place.
</p>
<p>Dorothy Morton and her old gray goose
continued their stately walk across the meadow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
Only once did the goose&#8217;s dignity forsake it.
Grace&#8217;s excitable rooster crossed its path! The
rooster had made a short scurry to the side, his
driver trying to persuade him back to the
straight path. As the rooster hurried past the
old gray goose, the latter stopped short, gave
an indignant flap of its wings, rose a few inches
from the ground, and pecked at Mr. Rooster.
A moment later the goose continued its dignified
march.
</p>
<p>This incident was too much for Grace&#8217;s irascible
rooster. With a terrified crow he darted
first this way, then that, until Grace was wound
up in her own red silk reins. It seemed a hopeless
task to try to reach the goal.
</p>
<p>It was another instance of the old story of
the hare and the tortoise. While Grace struggled
with her rooster, a fat duck waddled past
her. The duck&#8217;s mistress had enticed her
nearly the whole length of the journey by
throwing grains of corn a yard or so ahead of
her steed. Of course, any well disposed duck
would move forward for refreshments.
</p>
<p>Dorothy Morton arrived safely at the first
goal with her old gray goose. But now her
troubles really began. Her steed had no disposition
to return to the crowd of noisy spectators
that it had so cheerfully left behind.
Dorothy tugged at one of her heavy white reins.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
The goose continued placidly on its way across
the broad field. A goose is not a pleasant bird
in attack, and Dorothy did not like to resort to
forcible methods.
</p>
<p>Assistance came from an unexpected quarter.
Grace&#8217;s rooster had at last been persuaded to
rush violently between the required posts. In
one of its excited turns, it brushed close behind
the old goose. Here was a chance for revenge!
The rooster gave a flying peck at the goose&#8217;s
tail feathers and flew on.
</p>
<p>With a loud squawk the goose turned completely
around. It flew up in the air, then
down to the ground again, and made a rush for
its opponent. But the rooster was unworthy
game. It tacked too often to the right and left.
The old gray goose gave up its pursuit in disgust.
Since it was headed toward the starting-place
it took up its walk again, Dorothy Morton
meekly following it.
</p>
<p>Only three of the girls remained in the race.
Ruth had given up in despair. Her turkey had
wandered off to parts unknown. Another girl
sat on an upturned stump feeding crumbs to a
motherly hen that had found walking disagreeable
and had taken to scratching around the
roots of a tree.
</p>
<p>Dorothy passed her rival with the duck midway
on her journey back home. The duck
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
took no further interest in corn. It had eaten
all that a well-bred fowl could desire. Now it
squatted in the grass to enjoy a well-earned
repose.
</p>
<p>Shrieks of laughter rose when Dorothy Morton
at last drove her gray goose back to the
judge&#8217;s stand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the old gray goose!&#8221; shouted
the spectators in merry applause.
</p>
<p>Franz Heller rushed down from the platform,
carrying two wreaths in his hands. One was
made of smilax and pink roses; the other a
small wreath of evergreens with a silver bell
fastened to it. Franz dropped the rose garland
over Dorothy Morton&#8217;s head. The small
wreath with the bell he placed on the neck of
the old gray goose.
</p>
<p>Exhausted, Dorothy dropped into the nearest
seat. The old gray goose wandered off toward
home, led by a proud farmer&#8217;s boy.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had the laughter from the first event
ceased, when the Thread and Needle Race was
called for.
</p>
<p>Ralph Ewing was an easy winner, thanks to
Mollie&#8217;s skill as a seamstress. Ralph declared
the button she sewed on him should ornament
his coat for evermore.
</p>
<p>But the Egg and Spoon Race was a closely
contested event.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>The race appeared to be a tie between Ambassador
Morton and Mr. Winthrop Latham.
</p>
<p>Near-sighted Franz Heller made a brave
start, but his eyes betrayed him. Carefully
carrying his egg in a spoon which he bore at
arm&#8217;s length, Franz forgot to look down at his
feet. He stumped his toe against a small stone.
Crash, the egg rolled from his spoon! A yellow
stream marked the place where it fell.
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham and the Ambassador were painstaking
men. They ran along, side by side, at a
gentle pace. The man who arrived first at the
appointed goal with an unbroken egg was, of
course, the victor.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr. Latham, an old habit
overcame him. In the midst of the contest he
paused to adjust his glasses. The movement of
his arm was fatal. His spoon tipped and his
egg rolled gently to the earth.
</p>
<p>Still the Ambassador continued unmoved on
his stately journey. With a smile he solemnly
handed an unbroken white egg to Reginald
Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, cook this for your breakfast!&#8221; he advised
Reginald, who was acting as judge of this
famous event.
</p>
<p>Cutting a lemon with a saber, and the Dummy
Race, ended the morning&#8217;s sports. The afternoon
was to be devoted to riding.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>BARBARA AND BEAUTY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Barbara, you are eating very little
luncheon,&#8221; Ralph Ewing whispered
in Bab&#8217;s ear.
</p>
<p>Ambassador and Mrs. Morton were entertaining
a large number of friends in the dining-room
of the clubhouse.
</p>
<p>Maud Warren smiled patronizingly across the
table at Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you nervous about our riding this afternoon?&#8221;
Maud asked. &#8220;Mr. Heller, do please
pass Miss Thurston those sandwiches. She
must want something to keep up her courage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kind-hearted Franz Heller hurriedly presented
Bab with all the good things he could
reach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Heller,&#8221; said Barbara,
gratefully. Her cheeks were crimson; her
brown eyes flashed, but she made no reply.
Mollie, who knew Bab&#8217;s quick temper, wondered
how her sister controlled herself.
</p>
<p>A horn blew to announce that the luncheon
hour was ended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along, child,&#8221; Miss Stuart called nervously
to Bab. &#8220;Now, do, pray be careful! I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
shall certainly be glad when this riding contest
is over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the guests of the Society Circus were
at luncheon the field had been arranged for the
hurdle-jumping.
</p>
<p>Inside the green meadow four short length
fences had been set up, a quarter of a mile apart.
The girls were to ride around the field on their
horses and jump the four hurdles.
</p>
<p>Besides Bab and Maud Warren, four other
Lenox girls had entered for this race. The
riders were all skilled horsewomen.
</p>
<p>Ambassador Morton waved his hand to Bab
as she cantered by him on his little horse,
Beauty. Her friends called out their good
wishes. Bab smiled and nodded. She never
looked so well or so happy as when she was on
the back of a horse.
</p>
<p>Ambassador Morton cautioned the girls before
they started for their ride. &#8220;Remember,
this is just a friendly contest,&#8221; he urged.
&#8220;We merely want to see you young people
ride. No one may allow her horse to cross
too close in front of another horse. Two of
you must not try to jump the hurdle at the same
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The six girls cantered bravely down the field.
</p>
<p>Maud Warren and Bab rode side by side.
Barbara was the youngest and smallest of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
girls, but she rode her little horse as though she
were a part of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit too closely in your saddle,&#8221; Maud
Warren leaned over and spoke patronizingly to
Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; Bab replied.
</p>
<p>The girls were now riding swiftly across the
meadow.
</p>
<p>Ralph, Hugh, Ruth, Mollie and Grace left
their places and hurried down to the fence that
inclosed the riding ring.
</p>
<p>At the first fence two of the horses refused
to jump. The other four sprang easily over the
bars.
</p>
<p>By the rules of the contest, the girls were not
allowed to urge their horses, so the two riders
went quietly back.
</p>
<p>At the second hurdle, another horse faltered.
This left the riding contest to Bab, Maud Warren,
and a Lenox girl, Bertha Brokaw.
</p>
<p>Barbara was as gay and happy as possible.
She had no thought of fear in riding. Beauty
was a splendid little horse accustomed to being
ridden across country. The beautiful little
animal jumped over the low bars as easily
as if she were running along the ground.
</p>
<p>Bertha Brokaw was the first of the three girls
to go over the third hurdle. Bab was close behind
her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Barbara had just risen in her saddle. &#8220;Go it,
Beauty!&#8221; she whispered, gently.
</p>
<p>At this instant, Maud Warren gave a smart
cut to her horse and crossed immediately in
front of Bab.
</p>
<p>Beauty reared on her hind feet. Barbara and
the horse swayed an instant in the air.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart rose from the chair where she sat.
Mrs. Morton gave a gasp. A sudden terror
shook all the spectators. Poor Mollie turned
sick and faint. She imagined her beloved Bab
crushed beneath a falling horse.
</p>
<p>But Barbara was not conscious of anything
but Beauty. As her little horse rose trembling
on its hind feet Bab remembered to keep her
reins slack. With one pull on the horse&#8217;s tender
mouth, she and Beauty would have gone
over backwards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, Beauty! Steady!&#8221; she cried. The
horse ceased to tremble, and a moment later
stood on all four feet again.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Maud Warren had cleared
the third fence and was riding across the field.
Not a sound of applause followed her. But as
Beauty, with Barbara still cool and collected,
sprang easily over the hurdle, loud applause
rang out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for Bab!&#8221; cried Ralph, shaking Ruth&#8217;s
hand in his excitement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a trick! I didn&#8217;t think Maud Warren
capable of it,&#8221; protested Dorothy to her
father.
</p>
<p>Bertha Brokaw&#8217;s horse was tired. She did
not finish the mile course.
</p>
<p>Now again Barbara rode side by side with
Miss Warren. Just before the last jump Bab
reined in a little. She remembered the Ambassador&#8217;s
instructions. This was only a riding
match, not a racing contest. No two girls were
allowed to jump a hurdle at the same time.
</p>
<p>So Barbara gave Maud Warren the first opportunity
to make the jump. But Maud was
nervous; she realized she had taken an unfair
advantage of Bab. Her horse refused to jump.
Bab waited only an instant. Then, urging
Beauty on, they rose over their last hurdle like
swallows.
</p>
<p>Barbara came cantering back to her friends,
her cheeks rosy, her eyes shining with delight.
</p>
<p>Franz Heller rushed forward with a big bunch
of American Beauty roses. Flowers were the
only prizes given during the day. Barbara
slid down off her horse.
</p>
<p>The Ambassador moved forward to shake
hands with her; Bab&#8217;s friends were waving
their handkerchiefs; but Bab had eyes for
Beauty only. A stable boy had come to lead
the horse away.
</p>

Barbara and Beauty Swayed an Instant in the Air.
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, you little Beauty!&#8221; Bab whispered,
with her brown head close to the horse&#8217;s
face. &#8220;You are the dearest little horse in the
world. Don&#8217;t I wish you were my very own!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ambassador Morton overheard Bab&#8217;s speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me give the horse to you, Miss Thurston,&#8221;
he urged. &#8220;It will give me the greatest
pleasure, if you will allow it. He ought to belong
to you for the pretty piece of riding you
did out in the field. Let me congratulate you.
Beauty&#8217;s compliments and mine to the young
girl who has been her own riding teacher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A warm wave of color swept over Barbara&#8217;s
face. &#8220;I did not mean you to overhear me, Mr.
Morton,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Forgive me. Of
course I couldn&#8217;t accept your horse. But I do
appreciate your kindness. Thank you for lending
me Beauty to ride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab took her roses from Mr. Heller and made
her way to Miss Stuart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Child!&#8221; protested Miss Sallie, &#8220;sit down!
I shall ask your mother never to let you ride
a horse again unless you promise never to try
to jump over another fence rail. Oh, what I
went through, when I thought you were about
to fall off that horse!&#8221; Miss Stuart raised both
hands in horror. &#8220;There ought to be a law
against riding masters being allowed to teach
women to jump over hurdles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But the law wouldn&#8217;t act against Bab,
auntie,&#8221; declared Ruth, who was feeling very
vain over Bab&#8217;s success. &#8220;Because, you know,
Barbara never took a riding lesson in her life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a short time Miss Stuart took her party
home.
</p>
<p>Ralph and Hugh were to return to New
Haven on the night train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Sallie,&#8221; begged Mollie, as they made
their way through the crowd, &#8220;there is Mr.
Winthrop Latham. <i>Do</i> ask him to come to tea
with you to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, my child?&#8221; Miss Sallie naturally
inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, ask just him, not his nephew, Reginald.
Do, Aunt Sallie, dear. I can&#8217;t tell you
why, now, but I shall explain as soon as we get
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, you funny little girl.&#8221; And Miss
Stuart complied with Mollie&#8217;s request.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham promised to call on
Miss Stuart and her girls at their hotel the next
afternoon at four o&#8217;clock.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>EUNICE AND MR. WINTHROP LATHAM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ruth, may I go with you to get Eunice?&#8221;
Mollie Thurston asked next day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mollie. Are not the
four of us going? We want to bring little
Eunice back to the hotel in style. We have
had a hard enough time getting hold of her.
Her old Indian grandmother would not have let
us have the child if it had not been for Naki. The
Indian woman seems really to be attached to
Ceally and Naki.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to ask you a weeny little favor,
Ruth. I won&#8217;t tell you why I ask you now; but
I will tell you as soon as we are in the automobile.
Don&#8217;t ask Bab to come with us for
Eunice,&#8221; Mollie entreated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask Bab? Why, Mollie!&#8221; protested
Ruth, in surprise. &#8220;Bab&#8217;s feelings would be
dreadfully hurt if I did not ask her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t, Ruth. I have already talked
to Aunt Sallie. She told Bab she wanted her to
stay in the house this morning. Aunt Sallie
thinks Barbara is tired from her ride yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well, Mollie, I won&#8217;t urge Bab
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
to come with us, then; though I can&#8217;t understand
why you don&#8217;t want her along. I shall
be glad when you explain the mystery to me,&#8221;
Ruth concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why I wish to drive over with you.
Sh! Aunt Sallie is coming. Don&#8217;t say anything
before her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; explained Mollie, as the three girls
were hurrying toward Pittsfield in their motor
car, &#8220;I want to tell you why I did not wish Bab
to come along with us to the hospital for Eunice.
I don&#8217;t know what you and Grace may
think of me; but I intend to try an experiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An experiment, Mollie!&#8221; Grace exclaimed.
&#8220;What experiment do you intend to try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well girls,&#8221; Mollie continued, &#8220;do you recall
that Bab went driving, a few days ago, with
Reginald Latham, Mr. Winthrop Latham and
Aunt Sallie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth and Grace both nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you remember Bab said she was going
to discover, on that drive, what connection Eunice
had with the Latham family?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Grace assented. &#8220;Do hurry on to the
point of your story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you must hear it all over again,&#8221; Mollie
protested. &#8220;I want you and Ruth to remember
just exactly the story Bab told us. Reginald
Latham did not wish the subject of Eunice mentioned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
before his uncle, because Mr. Winthrop
Latham&#8217;s oldest brother had married an Indian
girl. It seems the brother met the Indian girl
while he was studying the history of the Indians
in this neighborhood; so he just married her without
mentioning the fact to his family. Of course
the Lathams, who were very rich and very distinguished,
were heart-broken over the marriage.
And I guessed they were not any too
good to the poor little Indian woman, when Mr.
William Latham brought her back to his home
to live. As soon as her husband died, she ran
away to her own people. When Mr. Winthrop
Latham tried to find her some time afterwards,
to give her her husband&#8217;s property, it seems that
the Indian wife was dead. At any rate Reginald
declares this to be the case. From that day
to this, the Latham family never speak of anything
that even relates to Indians.&#8221; Mollie
ended her speech in a slightly scornful tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mollie, don&#8217;t you think that is a good
enough explanation of Reginald Latham&#8217;s attitude
toward Eunice?&#8221; Ruth asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I most certainly do not!&#8221; Miss Mollie replied.
&#8220;And how do you explain the Indian
squaw&#8217;s feeling against the name of Latham?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bab told us, Reginald explained all that
to her, too. It seems that the Indians in this
vicinity believed poor little Mrs. Latham had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
been persecuted by her husband&#8217;s family. So,
if this old squaw ever heard the story, Latham
would be an evil name to her,&#8221; Grace put in.
</p>
<p>Mistress Mollie shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I
think that story is very unlikely. But, maybe,
you believe it, just as Bab did. All I ask of you
is&mdash;just be on the look-out to-day! I have been
doing a little detective work myself. I do not
agree with Bab&#8217;s explanation. I told you I was
going to try an experiment, and I want you to
help me. Then maybe, I can convince you, Bab,
and Aunt Sallie of something that I believe! I
am sure our little Indian Eunice has a closer
connection with the Latham family than any of
you dream!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, but you are interesting, Mollie!&#8221;
interrupted Ruth. &#8220;I have a suspicion of what
you mean. But go ahead, little Miss Sherlock
Holmes! We are with you to the end. We
shall be delighted to render any humble assistance
necessary to your detective work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only want you to watch developments this
afternoon, girls!&#8221; Mollie asserted mysteriously.
&#8220;Later on, there may be some real work for us
to do. So far, I have planned everything myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mollie, you are a nice one!&#8221; laughed
Grace. &#8220;Kindly &#8216;put us on,&#8217; as the saying goes.
What have you planned?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but a meeting between Eunice and
Mr. Winthrop Latham,&#8221; Mollie responded.
&#8220;We are to take Eunice to the hotel to spend the
day with us. She will be looking her best in
the lovely clothes Ruth sent to her. And she has
grown almost fair from her weeks in the hospital.
Mr. Winthrop Latham is to have tea with
us this afternoon. I asked Aunt Sallie to invite
nobody but him. I shall bring Eunice quietly
in, introduce her to Mr. Latham: then we shall
see what happens! I did not wish to tell Bab
my plan,&#8221; Mollie continued, &#8220;because she
might make me give it up. But I believe Aunt
Sallie agrees with me, though she did give me a
scolding for having a suspicious nature! She
declared, this morning, that it would be very
well to have Mr. Winthrop Latham see Eunice.
So just let&#8217;s wait, and watch with all our eyes
this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for your experiment, Mollie!&#8221; nodded
Grace. Ruth bowed her head to show how fully
she agreed with both of the girls.
</p>
<p>A pretty hospital nurse brought Eunice out to
Ruth&#8217;s motor car. The child had on a soft ecru
dress, cut low at the throat and simply made.
She wore a brown coat, lined with scarlet, and
a big brown felt hat with a scarf knotted loosely
around it.
</p>
<p>And Eunice looked very lovely! Her hair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
was braided in two plaits, tied with soft scarlet
ribbons. Her eyes were big and black with the
excitement of entering a strange world. Her
complexion was now only a little darker than
olive. Her cheeks were like two scarlet flames.
</p>
<p>Eunice hugged Mollie close, once she was
seated in the automobile. When the big car
started, she laughed gleefully, clapping her
hands as she cried. &#8220;It is truly a red bird, that
carries us on its wings!&#8221; She remembered what
Ruth had told her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always Eunice has longed for wings like
the birds!&#8221; Eunice whispered softly to Mollie.
&#8220;Now, behold! We are almost flying!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look overhead, Mollie, Eunice, Ruth!&#8221;
called Grace suddenly.
</p>
<p>The four girls looked up.
</p>
<p>A great white object sailed above them.
</p>
<p>Eunice clutched Mollie. &#8220;Is it the great
white spirit, my grandmother has told me
about?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is Reginald Latham in his airship,&#8221;
Mollie explained to Grace. &#8220;He said
the rudder of Mr. Latham&#8217;s balloon had been
mended. He meant to try some short flights to
see if it was all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not understand!&#8221; Eunice protested.
&#8220;Is a man riding on that great, great
big bird?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Eunice,&#8221; Mollie assented. &#8220;But that
object above our heads is an airship, not a
bird.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wish to ride in an airship,&#8221; Eunice
murmured. &#8220;It flies up in the air like a real
bird. This car runs only along the earth.&#8221;
The child was no longer impressed with the
automobile. Reginald Latham&#8217;s airship was
the most marvelous thing she had ever beheld.
</p>
<p>After arriving at their hotel &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; showed Eunice everything they could
find to amuse her. They rode up and down
with her in the elevator. They gave her a peep
into the hotel&#8217;s splendid reception rooms. Poor
little Eunice was in a daze! She wandered
about like a child in a dream. Every now and
then she would ask Mollie some question in regard
to Reginald Latham&#8217;s airship. She had
not forgotten it.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart wisely had luncheon served in the
private sitting-room. She did not think it best
for Eunice to be seen by so many people; besides,
she did not know how Eunice would behave
at the table.
</p>
<p>To Miss Sallie&#8217;s unspeakable relief the child
had learned at the hospital to eat with a knife
and fork. Her manners were those of a frightened
child. She was neither noisy nor vulgar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The child is certainly an enigma!&#8221; Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Stuart said to herself, half a dozen times during
the morning. &#8220;What the doctor says is true!
The child is almost refined. It is marvelous! In
spite of her ignorance, she does nothing to
offend one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After luncheon, Miss Stuart noticed that
Eunice looked white and exhausted. The scarlet
color had faded from her cheeks and lips.
The little girl was not strong enough for so
much excitement after her recent illness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; Miss Sallie suggested, about half-past
two o&#8217;clock, &#8220;take Eunice to your room.
Give her a dressing gown, and see that she rests
for an hour or so. You may stay with the
child, Mollie, for fear she may be frightened,
but you other girls keep away. The child is
worn out. Mollie, you may bring her back to
us at tea-time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie agreed. She guessed that Miss Sallie
was furthering her idea about the experiment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, Bab, you have promised me to
be here at tea-time,&#8221; Mollie reminded her sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, I shall be here, Mollie. Did you
think I was going away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie then took Eunice away to lie down.
</p>
<p>The child was so tired she soon fell asleep
on Mollie&#8217;s bed.
</p>
<p>Mollie sat thinking quietly by the darkened
window. She had taken a deep fancy to little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Eunice, who had seemed to cling to her since
their first strange meeting.
</p>
<p>Barbara and Mollie Thurston were both unusually
thoughtful girls. Their mother&#8217;s devoted
companions for years, their poverty had
made them understand more of life. Mollie
realized it would not do for Eunice to grow up
ignorant and wild, with only her old grandmother
for a companion. The little Indian was
already thirsting for a different life. And,
some day, the grandmother would die. What
would then become of Eunice?
</p>
<p>A little before four o&#8217;clock Eunice awakened,
having slept nearly two hours. She was refreshed
and happy again.
</p>
<p>Mollie made Eunice bathe her face. She herself
fixed the child&#8217;s hair, now smooth and
glossy from the care that the nurses at the hospital
had given to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go back to see our friends now,
Eunice,&#8221; explained Mollie.
</p>
<p>Eunice nodded. &#8220;It is wonderful here where
you live!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Sometimes I think
I have dreamed of people like you and your
friends. I think I have seen things like what
you have here in this house. But how could I
dream of what I knew nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie shook her head thoughtfully.
&#8220;Eunice, dear, you will have to ask a wiser
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
person than I am about your dreams. Who
knows what may be stored away in that little
head of yours? Come, dear, let us put your
gold chain on the outside of your dress. There
can be no harm in that. I think Miss Sallie,
the lady with the white hair, would like to look
at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice, who had a girl&#8217;s fancy for pretty ornaments,
was glad to have Mollie pull the chain
out from under her dress. The curious, beautiful
ornament shone glittering and lovely
against the light background formed by the
child&#8217;s dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for me here, Eunice,&#8221; requested Mollie.
&#8220;I want to go into the other room for a
minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie peeped inside the sitting-room door.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham was cosily drinking his
tea in the best of humor. He had a decided
liking for Miss Stuart and her &#8220;Automobile
Girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bab was joking with Mr. Latham as she plied
him with sandwiches and cakes.
</p>
<p>For half a minute Mollie&#8217;s heart misgave her.
She was afraid to try her experiment.
</p>

The Cup in Mr. Latham&#8217;s Hand Trembled.
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; she thought, finally, &#8220;what
possible harm can it do Mr. Winthrop Latham
to look at poor, pretty little Eunice? If the
child means nothing to him, he will not even
notice her. If she turns out to be the child I
believe she is, why, then&mdash;then&mdash;it is only right
that her uncle, Mr. Winthrop Latham, should
know of her existence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now, Eunice!&#8221; cried Mollie. &#8220;Come
into the sitting-room with me. The girls have
some pretty cakes and sweet things they are
saving for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollie took Eunice&#8217;s hand. The two girls
were nearly of the same size and age. They
quietly walked into the sitting-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is &#8216;Automobile Girl&#8217; number four?&#8221;
Mollie heard Mr. Latham ask, just as the two
girls entered the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am!&#8221; Mollie replied.
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham glanced up. His ruddy face
turned white as chalk.
</p>
<p>Mollie never took her eyes from Mr. Latham&#8217;s
face. Miss Stuart, Bab, Grace and Ruth stared
at him.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Latham did not notice any one of
them. His jaw dropped. The cup in his hand
trembled. Still he did not speak.
</p>
<p>Barbara broke the silence. &#8220;Mr. Latham,
are you ill?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;May I take your teacup
from you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham shook his head. He continued
to gaze steadily at Eunice.
</p>
<p>Little Eunice was frightened by the strange
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
man&#8217;s stare. She trembled. Her rosebud lips
quivered. Tears rolled down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to me, Eunice,&#8221; Ruth called comfortingly.
&#8220;See the candies I have been saving for
you! Mr. Latham, this is the little Indian girl
who was hurt. You remember that we have
spoken of her before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will some one take the child away?&#8221; Mr.
Latham asked, brokenly.
</p>
<p>Mollie led Eunice back to her bedroom. Then
she hurried in again to rejoin the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stuart, I owe you and your girls an
explanation for my strange conduct,&#8221; Mr. Latham
declared. &#8220;I feel, this afternoon, that I
have seen a ghost! I do not understand this
Indian child&#8217;s likeness to my dead sister-in-law.
I must seek an explanation somewhere. This
little Eunice is the living image of my brother&#8217;s
Indian wife&mdash;the poor girl whom our cruelty
drove from our home back to the tents of her
own people to die. I was told that her little
child died with her. There is a mystery here
that must be solved. If this little girl is the
daughter of my brother and his Indian wife,
one-half of my fortune belongs to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Latham,&#8221; Miss Stuart quietly interrupted
him, &#8220;this Indian child has an old
grandmother who will be able to tell you
whether this child has any connection with you.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
I have always thought there must be some explanation.
The squaw has kept the child hidden
for a purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Miss Stuart,&#8221; Mr. Latham interrupted.
&#8220;You tell me this child&#8217;s name is
Eunice? Eunice was the name of my brother&#8217;s
wife. It is also the Christian name for the
female Indians of a certain tribe, but there is
little doubt, in my mind, of this girl&#8217;s identity.
The gold chain about her throat was my brother&#8217;s
gift to his wife. That chain has the story of
my brother&#8217;s love and courtship engraved on it
in Indian characters. But I am too much upset
to discuss the matter any further to-day. When
can I see the Indian grandmother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; Miss Stuart replied quietly.
&#8220;I would not advise you to delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go with me to see her at ten
o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning, Miss Stuart?&#8221; queried
Mr. Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Miss Sallie agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg of you then not to mention what has
taken place in this room this afternoon,&#8221; Mr.
Latham urged. &#8220;When we know the truth in
regard to this child it will be time to tell the
strange story. Good-bye until to-morrow
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mollie,&#8221; Bab cried as soon as the door
closed on Mr. Latham, &#8220;I surrender. And I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
humbly beg your pardon. You are a better detective
than I am. What is the discovery of the
Boy Raffles compared with your bringing to
light the family history of poor little Eunice!
Just think, instead of being a poor, despised
Indian girl, Eunice is heiress to a large fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you believe in me now, Bab!&#8221; Mollie
rejoined. &#8220;I have always thought Eunice
was in some way connected with the Latham
family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; Miss Stuart cautioned quietly,
&#8220;when you take Eunice to her grandmother, at
Naki&#8217;s house, say nothing. Remember, you are
to speak to no one of what happened this afternoon.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE AUTOMOBILE WINS</h3>
</div>

<p>Immediately after breakfast, next morning,
&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; started in
Ruth&#8217;s car for Naki&#8217;s house in Pittsfield.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart had decided that it would be best
to have Eunice out of the way when she and Mr.
Latham made their call on the grandmother.
</p>
<p>So the girls hurried off after Eunice.
</p>
<p>They were in splendid spirits as they approached
Naki&#8217;s house. No one of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
doubted, for an instant, that Mr. Winthrop Latham
would find little Eunice was his niece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You run in and ask the grandmother
whether Eunice may take a ride with us, Mollie,&#8221;
Ruth suggested as she stopped her car.
&#8220;If Naki is at home, ask him to step out here a
minute. I want to prepare him for the call of
Aunt Sallie and Mr. Latham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In three minutes Mollie flew out of the house
again. She was alone. There was no sign of
Eunice!
</p>
<p>&#8220;O girls!&#8221; Mollie cried, &#8220;Eunice and her
grandmother are gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone where?&#8221; Bab queried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to their own wigwam!&#8221; Mollie continued.
&#8220;Last night Ceally says a woman,
heavily veiled, came here, accompanied by a
young man. They talked to the Indian
woman and Eunice a long time. They told the
squaw a man was in pursuit of her. He would
come this morning to take her away. She was
so frightened that Naki and Ceally could do
nothing to influence her. She started with
Eunice, last night, for their wigwam in the hills.
Who do you think her visitors were?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Latham and Reginald!&#8221; cried the
other three girls at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so plain,&#8221; argued Ruth. &#8220;Mr. Latham
probably told his sister, last night, that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
had seen Eunice, and meant to come here, this
morning, and find out who the child really was.
Mrs. Latham and Reginald then rushed here to
get the squaw and the child out of the way until
they could have time to plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what shall we do now?&#8221; asked Mollie,
her eyes full of tears. &#8220;I do not believe Mrs.
Latham and Reginald will be content with sending
Eunice and her grandmother back to their
own hill. Mr. Latham could follow them up
there. I know they will try to spirit Eunice
away altogether. They will not wait. Oh,
what, what can we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Ruth answered quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any money, girls?&#8221; she inquired.
&#8220;I have twenty-five dollars with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have twenty with me,&#8221; Grace replied. &#8220;I
have ten,&#8221; declared Bab. &#8220;And I have only
five,&#8221; Mollie answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are all right for money,&#8221; said
Ruth. &#8220;Naki,&#8221; she continued, turning to their
guide, who had now come out to them, &#8220;I want
you to give this note to Aunt Sallie and Mr.
Latham when they come here. It will explain
all. Tell them not to worry. I shall send a
telegram before night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Taking a piece of paper from her pocket,
Ruth hurriedly wrote a letter of some length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s be off!&#8221; Ruth insisted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now, Ruth
Stuart?&#8221; Mollie demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what can we do,&#8221; Ruth replied, &#8220;except
go straight up to the wigwam for Eunice
and run away with her before anyone else can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run away with her!&#8221; faltered Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What else can we do?&#8221; queried Ruth. &#8220;If
we delay in getting Eunice out of Mrs. Latham&#8217;s
and Reginald&#8217;s clutches, they will place
the child where no one can ever find her. Mrs.
Latham will then persuade her brother to give
up his search. We must save Eunice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what will Aunt Sallie say?&#8221; cried Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have written Aunt Sallie,&#8221; Ruth explained,
&#8220;that we would take Eunice to a nearby
town. We can telegraph Aunt Sallie from
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, suppose, Ruth,&#8221; Grace suggested, &#8220;the
Indian grandmother will not let Eunice go with
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Grace,&#8221; Bab retorted, &#8220;&#8216;The
Automobile Girls&#8217; must overcome obstacles. I
believe the old grandmother will let Eunice come
with us, if we tell her the whole story. We must
explain that Mr. Winthrop Latham wants to see
Eunice in order to be kind to her and not to harm
her, and ask the squaw if Eunice is Mr. William
Latham&#8217;s child. We must make her understand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
that Mrs. Latham and Reginald are her
enemies, we are her friends&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all, Bab?&#8221; laughed Grace. &#8220;It
sounds simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Mollie now broke in to the
conversation, &#8220;I believe I can somehow explain
matters to Mother Eunice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By noon &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; were halfway
up the hill that led to the wigwam.
</p>
<p>Mollie, who was walking ahead, heard a low
sound like a sob. Crouched under a tree, several
yards away, was little Eunice. At the sight of
Mollie she ran forward. A few feet from her she
stopped. A look of distrust crossed her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you come here?&#8221; she asked in her
old wild fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Eunice,&#8221; Mollie asked quietly, &#8220;are
you not glad to see your friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At first, Eunice shook her head. Then she
flung her arms around Mollie&#8217;s neck. &#8220;I want
to give you that strange thing you called a
kiss,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am so glad to see you that
my heart sings. But grandmother told me you
meant to sell me to the strange man, who looked
at me so curiously yesterday. So I came back
up the hill with her. You would not sell me,
would you? You are my friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look into my eyes, Eunice,&#8221; Mollie whispered.
&#8220;Do I look as though I meant to harm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
you? You told me once that if you could see
straight into the eyes of the creatures in the
woods you would know whether their hearts
were good. Is my heart good?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; Eunice cried. &#8220;Forgive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we want you to have a great deal of
faith in us, Eunice,&#8221; Mollie persisted. &#8220;We
want you to go away with us this very afternoon.
Take us to your grandmother. We must ask her
consent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;I cannot go,&#8221; she
declared, finally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Eunice, if you will only go with us, you
can buy more pretty gold chains. You can buy
beads and Indian blankets for your grandmother,&#8221;
coaxed Grace. &#8220;Who knows? Some
day you may even own a big, red bird like
Ruth&#8217;s, and fly like &#8216;The Automobile Girls.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still Eunice shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will come with us, if your grandmother
says you may?&#8221; Ruth urged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Eunice declared. &#8220;I cannot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Eunice?&#8221; Mollie queried gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Eunice, &#8220;to-day I fly up in
the sky!&#8221; The child pointed over her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the child is mad from her illness and
the fatigue of her long walk up here,&#8221; Grace
ejaculated in distress.
</p>
<p>But Eunice laughed happily. &#8220;To-day I fly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
like the birds, high overhead. Long have I
wished to go up into the big blue heaven away
over the trees and the hilltops. To-day I shall
fly away, truly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls stared at Eunice in puzzled wonder.
They could understand nothing of the strange
tale she told them. Was the child dreaming?
</p>
<p>A light dawned upon Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; Mollie cried, &#8220;Reginald Latham is
going to take Eunice off in his airship!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be possible?&#8221; Bab exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; asked Mollie, &#8220;are you going for
a ride in the big balloon I showed you yesterday
as we rode away from the hospital?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Eunice declared. &#8220;Last night the
young man who came to Naki&#8217;s house talked with
me. He whispered to me, that if I were good and
did not tell my grandmother, he would take me
to ride with him in his great ship of the winds.
But he will bring me home to my own wigwam
to-night. I will go with you in your carriage to-morrow.
Now, I wait for the man to find me.
He told me to meet him here, away from my
grandmother&#8217;s far-seeing eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eunice,&#8221; Mollie commanded firmly, &#8220;come
with me to your wigwam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will tell my grandmother! Then
she will not let me fly away!&#8221; Eunice cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot fly with Reginald Latham,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
Eunice,&#8221; Mollie asserted. &#8220;He will not bring
you back again to the wigwam. He will leave
you in some strange town, away from your own
people. You will never see your grandmother.
You will never see us again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice, trembling, followed the other girls to
the wigwam.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; Bab said thoughtfully as they
walked on, &#8220;that Reginald Latham planned to
get Eunice away from this place forever. He
did not mean to injure her. He would probably
have put her in some school far away. But
Mr. Winthrop Latham would never have seen
her. Eunice would not then take half of the
Latham fortune from Reginald. Just think!
Who could ever trace a child carried away in an
airship? She might be searched for if she went
in trains or carriages, but no one but the birds
could know of her flight through the air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old grandmother heard &#8220;The Automobile
Girls&#8221; approaching.
</p>
<p>She was standing in front of a blazing fire.
With a grunt of rage, the old woman seized a
flaming pine torch and ran straight at Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put that down!&#8221; commanded Barbara,
hotly. &#8220;You are a stupid old woman. We
have come to save Eunice for you. Unless you
listen to us she will be stolen from you this very
afternoon. You will never see her again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
There is no use in your trying to hide Eunice
any longer. We know and her uncle knows,
that she is the child of your daughter and of
Mr. William Latham. You told Mr. Winthrop
Latham that Eunice died when her mother
did.&#8221; Barbara had depended on her imagination
for the latter part of her speech, but she
knew, now, that she had guessed the truth.
</p>
<p>Under her brown leather-like skin the old
squaw turned pale.
</p>
<p>Then Mollie explained gently to the old
woman that Mrs. Latham and Reginald were
Eunice&#8217;s enemies; that they wished to be rid
of Eunice so that they might inherit her father&#8217;s
money. She told of Reginald Latham&#8217;s
plan to carry Eunice away that afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mother Eunice,&#8221; Mollie ended,
&#8220;won&#8217;t you let little Eunice go away with us
this afternoon, instead? We will take good
care of her, and will bring her home to you in a
few days. But Eunice must see her uncle, Mr.
Winthrop Latham. You will not stand in the
way of little Eunice&#8217;s happiness, I know!&#8221;
Mollie laid her hand on the old squaw&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>But the squaw had bowed her head. She did
not notice Mollie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the end!&#8221; The old woman spoke to
herself. &#8220;I give up my child. The white blood
is stronger than the Indian. She will return to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
the race of her father. Her mother&#8217;s people
shall know her no more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May Eunice go away with us now?&#8221; Ruth
urged. &#8220;And won&#8217;t you go down to the village,
and stay with Naki and Ceally until
Eunice comes back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the child, when you will,&#8221; assented the
Indian woman. &#8220;She is mine no longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come, hurry, Eunice. We must be
off,&#8221; Bab cried.
</p>
<p>Eunice got her new coat and hat. Then she
flung her arms around her grandmother, and
kissed her in the way Mollie had taught her.
</p>
<p>The old Indian woman hugged the child to
her for one brief instant; then she relaxed her
hold and went back into her wigwam.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; and Eunice ran
down the hill.
</p>
<p>In half an hour they found &#8220;Mr. A. Bubble.&#8221;
He was patiently awaiting their return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump into the car in a hurry,&#8221; Ruth cried.
&#8220;Put Eunice in the middle. We have a long
distance to travel before night falls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls leaped into the automobile. It sped
away through the autumnal woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, do look up above us!&#8221; Mollie exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Away above their heads something white
sailed and circled in the air.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is Reginald Latham in his airship,&#8221; cried
Grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Reginald Latham,&#8221; laughed Mollie,
&#8220;an airship may do the business of the future;
but for present purposes I&#8217;ll bet on the
automobile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For hours &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; drove
steadily on. The roads were well marked with
signposts. Ruth wished to make a nearby town
away from the main line of travel.
</p>
<p>At dusk they arrived in North Adams.
</p>
<p>Ruth drove at once to a telegraph office, where
she telegraphed to Miss Sallie: &#8220;Safe in North
Adams with Eunice. Had a fine trip. Expect
you and Mr. Latham in the morning. All is
well. Do not worry. Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth and her friends put up at the Wilson
House in North Adams. They explained to the
hotel proprietor that they were staying in Lenox.
Their aunt would join them the next day.
</p>
<p>Five weary girls slept the sleep of the just.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE RECOGNITION</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Stuart and Mr. Winthrop Latham
did not arrive in North Adams
the next morning.
</p>
<p>A little before noon, Miss Sallie telegraphed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
to Ruth: &#8220;Must see Indian woman before we join
you. Proof of child&#8217;s identity required. Wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth showed her telegram to the girls.
</p>
<p>Barbara shook her head. &#8220;More of the work
of Mrs. Latham and Reginald,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>Soon after the receipt of Ruth&#8217;s telegram, the
afternoon before, Miss Stuart telephoned Mr.
Winthrop Latham, &#8220;Will you please come to
the hotel to see me immediately?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now, Miss Sallie realized her difficult position.
How was she to protect the interests of Eunice
without accusing Mr. Latham&#8217;s relatives of evil
designs against the child?
</p>
<p>She called up Naki in Pittsfield and told him
to come to her hotel that evening. &#8220;Naki can
tell Mr. Latham what I cannot,&#8221; Miss Sallie reflected.
&#8220;He can report the visit of Mrs. Latham
and Reginald to the Indian squaw, and can
make Mr. Latham see his sister&#8217;s intentions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham arrived first for the interview
with Miss Stuart. He looked worn and tired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My &#8216;Automobile Girls&#8217; have run off with
Eunice!&#8221; Miss Stuart at once informed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should there be any running away with
the child?&#8221; Mr. Latham asked impatiently. &#8220;I
could very easily have gone up to the wigwam
in the morning. I think, in many respects, it
will be wisest to see the Indian woman and child
on their own ground. To tell you the truth, Miss
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
Stuart, I shall require positive proofs that this
Indian girl is the child that my brother&#8217;s Indian
wife carried away from our home years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Latham,&#8221; Miss Stuart replied
quietly. &#8220;I entirely agree with you; but I think
it may be possible to secure such proofs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been talking to my sister and nephew
of this child,&#8221; Mr. Latham continued. &#8220;They
regard the idea that this little Eunice is the
daughter of my brother&#8217;s wife as absurd. They
recalled the fact that we were positively assured
of the child&#8217;s death. They do not believe it possible
that the Indian relatives would not have
claimed the child&#8217;s fortune for her. There were
a number of educated Indians living in the town
of Stockbridge at the time. My brother&#8217;s wife
took refuge with them after leaving us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Mr. Latham,&#8221; Aunt Sallie rejoined,
&#8220;if the Indian grandmother cannot give you
satisfactory proofs of the child&#8217;s parentage,
possibly you can find the additional proofs in
Stockbridge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham was silent. He had not been
sorry to be persuaded by Mrs. Latham and Reginald
that Eunice was an impostor.
</p>
<p>Naki knocked at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather not see visitors, Miss Stuart,&#8221;
Mr. Latham declared. &#8220;I am entirely upset
by this present situation.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is only our Indian guide, Naki,&#8221; Miss Sallie
explained. &#8220;I sent for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki,&#8221; Miss Sallie began, as soon as the man
entered the room. &#8220;My niece has taken Eunice
away for a few days. She told me to ask you to
go up to the wigwam and bring the Indian
woman down to your house again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki shut his lips together. &#8220;The Indian
woman will not return to my house,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Miss Stuart asked, angrily.
&#8220;It is much better for her to be with you. She
will die up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She wishes to die up there,&#8221; Naki avowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; retorted Miss Stuart. &#8220;We
cannot let her suffer so because of the child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is afraid to come down the hill again,&#8221;
Naki continued. &#8220;She is afraid of the law.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should she be afraid of the law?&#8221; inquired
Mr. Latham.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell,&#8221; Naki replied; &#8220;but the woman
who came to my house with her son told the old
squaw she must hide. If her secret was discovered
she would be sent to prison.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What woman and her son came to your
house to see this squaw?&#8221; asked Mr. Latham.
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie sat with her hands tightly clasped,
scarcely daring to breathe. She had not dared to
hope that her plan would work out so well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know the lady,&#8221; said Naki sullenly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
&#8220;But the young man was Reginald Latham. He
was on the hill the day Eunice was hurt. He
went with us to the Indian woman&#8217;s wigwam.
She was angry at his coming.&#8221; Naki paused.
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham was frowning and looking
down at the pattern of the carpet. Miss
Stuart knew he realized that his sister and
nephew were playing a double game which, for
the time being, he preferred to ignore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Miss Stuart,&#8221; said Mr. Latham,
a few minutes later. &#8220;I shall join you in the
morning. If the Indian woman is at Naki&#8217;s
house, I will see her there; if not, I shall go to
her wigwam. Notwithstanding all that has happened,
she must have satisfactory proofs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart knew Mr. Latham now suspected
that both his sister-in-law and nephew were convinced
of Eunice&#8217;s identity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki,&#8221; Miss Sallie asked, &#8220;at daylight, to-morrow,
will you go to the old squaw&#8217;s wigwam?
Tell her that she shall not be punished,&#8221; continued
Miss Stuart. &#8220;I am very sorry for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Naki was looking at Miss Stuart. His solemn
face expressed surprise. &#8220;Do you mean you
have found out about Eunice?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Naki,&#8221; Miss Stuart rejoined.
&#8220;If you have known Eunice&#8217;s story, and have
not told it before, you have behaved very badly.
Tell the Indian woman to bring what proofs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
she has to convince Mr. Latham that little Eunice
is the child of her daughter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; Naki promised. &#8220;But I knowed
of Eunice in another way. There is a man in
Stockbridge as knows who the child is. He was
a preacher once. He is part Indian, part white.
He was with Eunice&#8217;s mother when she died.
She told him about the child, but begged him to
keep it a secret. The Indian mother did not
want the child to go back to the Lathams. She
was afraid they would be unkind to her baby.
The man told me the story several years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Sallie was deeply interested. &#8220;Naki,
when you bring the squaw to your house in the
morning, go to Stockbridge. Then find the man
who knows the story of Eunice, and bring him,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can count on me,&#8221; were Naki&#8217;s last
words.
</p>
<p>The next morning Miss Stuart and Mr. Latham
drove to Naki&#8217;s home. Neither Naki nor
the Indian woman was there!
</p>
<p>Naki had left for the wigwam before five
o&#8217;clock that morning. It was now ten. There
was nothing to do but wait.
</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock Miss Sallie sent her telegram
to Ruth. At noon she and Mr. Latham
still waited. There was no sign of Naki or the
squaw.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we had better go up to the
wigwam?&#8221; Mr. Latham asked impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot find our way there without Naki
or one of my girls,&#8221; Miss Sallie answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think has happened?&#8221; Miss
Stuart asked Ceally. Ceally shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is the matter,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;or
Naki would have been here with the old woman
hours ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What had become of Naki?
</p>
<p>At daylight he reached the hilltop, but no
sound of life came from the silent tent.
</p>
<p>Naki called to the Indian squaw. There was
no answer. &#8220;I come to bring you news of
Eunice!&#8221; he shouted. Still no answer.
</p>
<p>He stalked inside the wigwam. The tent was
deserted. The Indian woman had disappeared.
</p>
<p>Naki was puzzled. He searched the woods
near the tent.
</p>
<p>Half way down the hill Naki came across a
small wooden box, half covered with leaves.
Naki opened it. In it he found half a dozen
pieces of old jewelry, and an old fashioned
daguerreotype of an Indian girl holding a baby
in her arms.
</p>
<p>Naki had been born and brought up in the
woods. He kept his eyes turned to the ground,
thinking to trace the footprints of Mother Eunice
down the hill. On her departure she had,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
as she thought, buried her box of treasures.
Then she had gone&mdash;where?
</p>
<p>Naki discovered, midway on the hill, two pairs
of footprints, which seemed to indicate that two
persons had lately started up the hill. But they
must have given up and gone down again.
</p>
<p>Naki made up his mind to go at once to
Stockbridge. Even though he could not trace
the squaw, the testimony of the man who had
seen Eunice&#8217;s mother die, the box of jewelry
Naki had found&mdash;these proofs of Eunice&#8217;s identity
would convince even Mr. Winthrop Latham.
</p>
<p>Miss Stuart and Mr. Latham were at luncheon
when Ceally entered the room. Miss Sallie
knew, at once, something had happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Ceally?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have come!&#8221; said Ceally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Mr. Latham demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naki, the Indian woman, and another man,&#8221;
was Ceally&#8217;s reply. There was a short pause,
and then the two entered.
</p>
<p>Naki spoke first. He explained that he had
found the Indian woman at Stockbridge when
he had given her up for lost. Then she told in
her own way that she had made up her mind to
return to Stockbridge and ask help from the man
who, alone, knew the story of her grandchild&#8217;s
parentage. The old squaw had completely
broken down. She said that she knew that it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
was best for Eunice to be allowed to come into
her inheritance. She said she remembered that
Barbara had told her of Mrs. Latham and Reginald&#8217;s
wish to keep Eunice concealed. She finished
by telling that midway on the hill, in the
early dawn, she had met Reginald Latham and
his mother climbing up to her tent. The old
squaw, who was wise, had told Mrs. Latham that
there was one man in Stockbridge who could
prove who Eunice was and that she would go and
implore him to keep the child&#8217;s parentage a secret.
Mrs. Latham and Reginald were delighted,
and urged the old woman to go.
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham listened quietly to Mother Eunice&#8217;s
story and to that of the man from Stockbridge,
who bore the old woman witness.
</p>
<p>It was a simple story. The Indian grandmother
thought her daughter had been unhappy
because of her marriage into the Latham family,
believing the girl had been persecuted because
of her Indian blood. So she wished to
spare her grandchild the same fate.
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham was entirely convinced. Eunice
was his niece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, finally, to Miss Stuart.
&#8220;Let us be off to our girls!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother Eunice,&#8221; he said solemnly, shaking
the old squaw&#8217;s hand, &#8220;I promise to be good to
your child. You shall not be separated from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
her. But she must be educated as other girls
are. Stay here with Ceally and Naki.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian woman bowed her head. She had
given in forever when she surrendered Eunice to
&#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; the afternoon before.
</p>
<p>But what about Eunice and her protectors?
They had not dared to leave the hotel for fear
that Aunt Sallie and Mr. Latham might arrive
in their absence.
</p>
<p>So the girls were waiting with the best patience
possible, curled up in the chairs and on
the sofa. Barbara was reading aloud. Little
Eunice had fallen fast asleep on the bed.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Miss Sallie and Mr. Latham walked
in unannounced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a cosy party!&#8221; declared Mr.
Latham, smiling.
</p>
<p>Bab dropped her magazine, Ruth sat up
straight in her chair, while Mollie and Grace
nearly rolled off their sofa.
</p>
<p>Their noise wakened Eunice, who sat up in
bed with her cheeks flushed. Her black hair
was massed about her face. She wore a red
dressing gown that Ruth had bought for her the
night before. She was so pretty that Mr. Latham
was moved by her appearance.
</p>
<p>But Eunice was frightened when she saw Mr.
Latham&mdash;he was the man who had stared at her
so strangely&mdash;he was the man who meant to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
steal her, so, at least, Reginald Latham had told
Eunice. The little girl began to cry softly.
</p>
<p>Mollie started up to go to Eunice, but she
stopped at a frown from Miss Sallie. Mr. Latham
was approaching Eunice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to hurt you, Eunice,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Do I look like the bogie man, who
lives in the woods and comes to steal away
naughty children?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head. &#8220;There are no bogie
men in the woods. Wood fairies are all good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am no kind of fairy, Eunice. I am
an uncle. Do you know what an uncle is?&#8221;
Mr. Latham inquired.
</p>
<p>Eunice shook her head again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O Eunice, an uncle can be the nicest person
in the world!&#8221; Mollie exclaimed. &#8220;And
that is what Mr. Latham is going to be to you.
Kiss him, and tell him you mean to be good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop Latham and little Indian
Eunice kissed each other shyly and solemnly.
But in that kiss their affection was sealed.
</p>
<p>What Reginald Latham and his mother
thought of the discovery of the relationship between
Eunice and Mr. Winthrop Latham may be
easily imagined. Eunice as his niece would undoubtedly
inherit a large portion of his fortune.
And how was Reginald to be provided for? Bent
on the effort to conceal the relationship, Reginald
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
and his mother had started long before dawn to
walk up to the grandmother&#8217;s hut, and, as the
old squaw had explained, had met her on the
side of the hill. They had tried to induce her
to give them the name of the man in Stockbridge
who knew of Eunice&#8217;s parentage, but the
old woman was obdurate. Failing in this,
mother and son had returned to their home.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>WHAT TO DO WITH EUNICE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Bab, will you come out on the hotel
driveway a minute?&#8221; Ruth asked of
Barbara. Miss Sallie and the girls
were back in Lenox. Little Eunice was, for the
present, staying at their hotel with them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not dressed, Ruth, dear. I shall join
you in a minute,&#8221; Bab called back to her.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see, lady mine,&#8221; sang Ruth.
&#8220;But do, do hurry. Mollie, Grace and I are
waiting for you, and there is another friend
with us whom you will be de-lighted to see!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph, or Hugh?&#8221; Bab guessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither one this time!&#8221; Ruth declared.
&#8220;But now I must fly back. If you wish to know
what is going on, hurry along.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>On the hotel driveway Bab first discovered
Mr. Winthrop Latham with Aunt Sallie and
Eunice. Eunice had her hand in her uncle&#8217;s.
They had grown to be great friends.
</p>
<p>A little farther on Barbara spied Ruth, Mollie
and Grace. Near them stood a stable boy.
He was leading a beautiful little horse about by
the bridle. It was Beauty.
</p>
<p>Barbara looked around for Dorothy or Gwendolin
Morton. However, neither of the girls
could be seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Bab,&#8221; called Mollie.
</p>
<p>But Barbara had already run up to Beauty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O girls, I believe she knows me!&#8221; Bab exclaimed
in delight. The little horse neighed as
Bab stroked its glossy neck. It put its pretty
nose down near her hand and sniffed. Beauty
plainly expected a lump of sugar as a reward
for her morning call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you happen to bring the horse
over?&#8221; Bab asked of the stable boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The master said I was to put the horse in
the hotel stables until it could be shipped,&#8221; the
boy explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some one has bought Beauty!&#8221; Bab
cried, in distress. &#8220;I am so sorry! How could
Dorothy Morton ever have been willing to sell
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara noticed that Grace, Ruth and Mollie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
were smiling broadly. Mr. Winthrop Latham,
Aunt Sallie and Eunice had drawn near.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t Dorothy Morton sell Beauty
to a girl who cares more for the horse than
Dorothy does?&#8221; Ruth inquired.
</p>
<p>Bab shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Oh, very
well!&#8221; she pouted. &#8220;If Dorothy thinks there is
any other horse in the world to compare with
Beauty, she deserves to lose her. My sweet
little Beauty, good-bye!&#8221; Barbara cried.
</p>
<p>The stable boy grinned. Everyone was smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; Bab asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beauty is yours, Bab!&#8221; cried Mollie.
</p>
<p>Bab looked at Mollie indignantly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
fair to tease me, Mollie,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;You
know how much I really care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mollie is not teasing you, Bab,&#8221; Ruth
interrupted. &#8220;Read that tag!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Surely enough, on a card fastened by a blue
ribbon to Beauty&#8217;s bridle, Bab read her own
name and her sister&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we cannot accept such a gift from the
Ambassador!&#8221; Bab protested, feelingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ambassador did not give us Beauty,
Bab!&#8221; exclaimed Mollie.
</p>
<p>But Barbara had thrown her arms around
Ruth&#8217;s neck. &#8220;You are just the dearest, sweetest
friend in the world, Ruth Stuart!&#8221; she cried.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
&#8220;And I&#8217;d love you more than ever if I could.
But Mollie and I cannot accept Beauty from you.
You have done too much for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bab,&#8221; laughed Ruth, &#8220;you are the
most difficult person in the world to bestow a
present upon; but I am not guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who has given Beauty to us?&#8221; demanded
Bab.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No other person than Cousin Betty in St.
Paul!&#8221; answered Mistress Mollie. &#8220;Do you
remember, Bab? Mother wrote that Cousin
Betty meant to give us a beautiful present when
she came home. The present was to be a horse,
and Cousin Betty is going to give us the money
to take care of it. Mother was to buy the horse
when she returned to Kingsbridge. When you
wrote of your ride on Beauty, mother wrote to
Ruth to inquire if the horse were for sale. The
Ambassador and Dorothy were both willing to
sell her to us, but to no one else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what we have ever done to
deserve such good fortune.&#8221; Barbara spoke so
solemnly that her friends all laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have more news, and better news for
you, Bab!&#8221; cried Mollie, triumphantly, &#8220;mother
is willing for us to bring Eunice home with us
for the winter!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear little Eunice!&#8221; Bab said, kissing the
Indian girl.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never cease to be grateful to you and
to your mother for this kindness,&#8221; declared Mr.
Winthrop Latham, taking Barbara&#8217;s hand. &#8220;You
know the difficult situation in which I am placed
in regard to Eunice. I dare not take the child
home, at present, to live with my sister-in-law
and my nephew. It seemed even more cruel to
send Eunice to boarding school while the child
knows nothing of the world. But, if your kind
mother will keep her with you, let her go to
school, and teach her just a little of what you
know, I shall be deeply in your debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No such thing, Mr. Latham!&#8221; laughed Mollie.
&#8220;We are going to be in your debt for lending
us Eunice. Mother will just love her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am coming back next summer to see
you and my grandmother?&#8221; Eunice begged.
&#8220;You said, if I were very good, you would take
me to ride in your balloon some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Latham laughed. &#8220;Eunice will never be
happy until she learns to fly,&#8221; he declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate good-byes, don&#8217;t you, Aunt Sallie?&#8221;
Barbara asked Miss Stuart that night. Ruth,
Grace and Mollie were standing on a trunk trying
to fasten it. &#8220;The Automobile Girls&#8221; were
to leave Lenox early the next morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara, remember Ruth&#8217;s motto for &#8216;The
Automobile Girls.&#8217; We are never to say good-bye!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What then, Aunt Sallie?&#8221; asked Bab, Grace,
Mollie and Ruth in chorus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Automobile Girls&#8217; are always to say,&#8221;
declared Miss Sallie, gently, &#8220;not good-bye, but

<p>Really good and new stories for boys and girls are not
plentiful. Many stories, too, are so highly improbable as
to bring a grin of derision to the young reader&#8217;s face before
he has gone far. The name of ALTEMUS is a distinctive
brand on the cover of a book, always ensuring
the buyer of having a book that is up-to-date and fine
throughout. No buyer of an ALTEMUS book is ever
disappointed.
</p>
<p>Many are the claims made as to the inexpensiveness
of books. Go into any bookstore and ask for an Altemus
book. Compare the price charged you for Altemus
books with the price demanded for other juvenile books.
You will at once discover that a given outlay of money
will buy more of the ALTEMUS books than of those
